<p>The podcast-specific RSS feed is broken and isn’t going to be fixed anytime soon. I’ve tried a number of plugins for making podcast stuff, and most of them overbearing, overcomplicated things that assume your blog only exists to host a podcast. Also, I always get complaints that the RSS feed doesn’t work in iTunes or whatever, which is <em>the only thing I want the plugin to do</em>.</p>
<p>People are always telling me how easy and turnkey it is and how service X or plugin Y fixed everything, and it always ends up eating a bunch of time, causing confusion, and failing to work as advertised. I don’t know what sort of hassle you’re supposed to go through to get podcasting RSS to work, but it’s evidently more hassle than I’m willing to put up with. </p>

<p>Baychel played the game for the first time this week. Here’s what she thought. You can read more of her thoughts on <a href="https://bayberrystudio.wordpress.com/2017/03/06/overwatch-and-rewards/">her blog</a>.</p>
<p><strong>00:12:10: Horizon: Zero Dawn</strong></p>
<p>It’s out! And it’s good! It’s not nearly as Ubisoft-esque as we feared. </p>
<p><strong>00:32:59: Borderlands 2</strong></p>
<p>I’m back into the game, and playing multiplayer with the family. This game follows a very similar cycle to Diablo II. Obsession leads to burnout. Burnout leads to dormancy. A few years of dormancy results in renewed interest. Renewed interest leads back to obsession.</p>
<p>To add to this, I think Borderlands 2 has my favorite game trailer of all time:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>And because I know you’ll ask: Yes, I saw the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cw2gXq83n8">Gearbox talk on rendering tech that featured likely assets for Borderlands 3</a>. I might do a post on this at some point.</p>

<p>I think I need to stop getting excited when people say a game is “like Silent Hill”, because that phrase apparently means something different to me than to everyone else. When I hear it I think, “Horror that focuses on unease and foreboding of mystery rather than jumpscares and the stress of combat.” When other people say a game is like Silent Hill I think they mean, “Has fog.”</p>
<p>I think that “Shivercliff” might be the most on-the-nose spooky town name since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkness_Falls_(2003_film)">Darkness Falls</a>.</p>
<p><strong>0:18:55: Borderlands vs. Borderlands 2</strong></p>
<p>I’m willing to bet Josh isn’t the only one who preferred the original, but I’m interested to see what people have to say about it.</p>
<p>I said in the show that the Pre-Sequel kinda ruined the game for me. I loved playing as Athena to the point where she’s the only character I ever want to play, but I hate the environments and enemies in that game. So then I want to go back to Borderlands 2, but then realized I wouldn’t be able to play as Athena. </p>
<p>I dunno if they’re making another one of these things, but if they are it must be a long ways off. They haven’t even begun hinting that they might talk about it. I suspect they’re spending all their time on Battleborn.</p>

<p>Note that when I talk about the Monkey Island intro, I’m not talking about the modern remakes and remixes. I’m talking about this:</p>

<p>It sounds lo-fi now, but that blew me away in 1991.</p>

<strong>0:02:21: Baychel</strong></p>
<p>Who is this person named Baychel? What happened to Rachel? Why are you changing your name? Why don’t you like your original name? And while we’re at it, what goes into naming a human being anyway?</p>
<p><strong>0:10:29: Errant Signal</strong></p>

<p>It’s been over a month since your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZkib5-rHsI">last episode</a>. You okay buddy?</p>

<p>What’s your favorite mod?</p>

<p><strong>0:14:00: Day Jobs</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>What do you guys do for a living? I know most of you have blogs or youtube channels, but besides Shamus I don’t get the impression that it’s your livelihood.</p>

Hosts: Josh, Rutskarn, Shamus, Campster, and Baychel.

This is it! We finally get around to answering all those questions you’ve been sending us.

Show notes:
0:02:21: Baychel

Who is this person named Baychel? What happened to Rachel? Why are you changing your name? Why don’t you like your original name? And while we’re at it, what goes into naming a human being anyway?

0:10:29: Errant Signal

Dear Errant Signal,
It’s been over a month since your last episode. You okay buddy?
Love, Shamus

Chris said the next episode would be up before this podcast, and he was true to his word:

0:13:19: Favorite Mods

Dear Diecast
What’s your favorite mod?
Love, Christopher

0:14:00: Day Jobs

Dear Diecast,
What do you guys do for a living? I know most of you have blogs or youtube channels, but besides Shamus I don’t get the impression that it’s your livelihood.
Love, Christopher

0:15:30 Remembering The Escapist, and the evolution of gaming news.

0:29:33: The story of why Esther paid $420 to play Dishonored 2

Update: She’s enjoying it so far, but this is her first stealth game so progress is slow.

0:38:05: Why so Short?

How come everyone in first person games are so short? I started playing Soma the other day, and Simon is only approximately a head taller than his own toilet cistern. I remember being shorter than a lot of handrails in Bioshock, too. What’s going on?
Love, Christopher(6’1″)

0:45:55: History lesson

I forget what game this relates to.

0:48:29: Lovecraft

Dear Diecast
When Lovecraft’s monsters are involved, people are often sticklers about following the rules or philosophy of his stories. Why do people care about how uncaring eldritch monstrosities are? There isn’t a lot of complaining when greek monsters are used outside of tragedies or trolls aren’t defeated by porridge eating contests.
Lovecraft, Christopher

0:53:39: Favorite game in least favorite genre.

Greetings Crossers of the Rubicon!
What is your favourite game from your least favourite genre?
Keep on keep on-ing!

<p>It’s been ages since I did a videogame podcast and I don’t quite remember how it goes, but the guys assured me the show should start with about 20 minutes of random non-videogame bullshit. </p>
<p>Show notes: <span id="more-36449"></span><br>
<strong>0:02:03: Favorite Jokes</strong></p>
<p>We talked about our favorite jokes. Here is mine:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I laughed at this joke when I saw it in ~1996. I laughed at it every time I saw it afterwards. I laughed every time my brother quoted it at me in the early 2000’s. I laughed at it when I tried to repeat the joke on the show. I laughed at it when I looked up the video just now. </p>
<p>I dunno. It’s like this is the Everlasting Gobstopper of jokes. It never runs out for me.</p>
<p><strong>0:05:37: Man Walks Into a Bar</strong></p>
<p>A horse walks into a bar. The bartender looks at him and says, “Why the long face?”</p>
<p>This segment isn’t so much about the “Man walks into a bar” style of joke as it is about how we visualize jokes in our head. </p>
<p>I’ve mentioned Martin’s Bar before. If you’re trying to keep the continuity of your whole Shamus backstory straight, it was mentioned in <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=13314">this grim chapter</a> of my childhood. The building is still standing today, but it’s empty now. You can see it <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/411+E+Locust+St,+Butler,+PA+16001/@40.862801,-79.8911607,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x883362ee8c57afb3:0x1f96429f101796ab!8m2!3d40.862797!4d-79.888972">here</a>. (It’s the red brick building facing the corner.)</p>
<p>I suppose this means the Battlezone machine is gone.</p>
<p><strong>0:20:23: ASMR Videos</strong></p>
<p>As it’s been described to me, ASMR videos are designed to trigger that feeling of tingling excitement you get when you’re extremely happy. The sensation where you get goosebumps due to your overwhelming emotional state, and you feel simultaneously excited and yet serene. The last time I remember having that sensation was 1982. I was sitting on the couch by myself. The family had just set up the Christmas decorations and I was sitting in the darkened living room, staring at the constellations of colorful lights. Soft Christmas music was playing. I remember having this meta-thought about how soon this perfect moment would end, so I tried to memorize as much as I could. (And yet, I can’t remember what music was playing.)</p>
<p>I’ll probably never feel like that again. But maybe I should watch the Happy Gilmore clip a few more times to see if that does the trick.</p>
<p><strong>0:22:31: XCom 2</strong></p>
<p>My favorite part of the Xcom story is the part where I remembered that Bradley existed. Or was it Bradford? </p>
<p>Ah well. Whoever.</p>
<p><strong>0:37:42: FINAL Fantasy</strong></p>
<p>Josh has been playing the very last fantasy game. </p>
<p><strong>0:55:22: Dishonored 2</strong></p>
<p>Chris has just finished Dishonored 2.</p>
<p><strong>1:12:02: GTA V</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been playing GTA V for some reason. I have a love-hate relationship with this game. Parts of it are extraordinary. Parts of it sicken me. Other parts are just pathetic and irritating. </p>

Chris has just finished Dishonored 2.

I’ve been playing GTA V for some reason. I have a love-hate relationship with this game. Parts of it are extraordinary. Parts of it sicken me. Other parts are just pathetic and irritating.

Episode edited by <a href="http://www.blueberrystarstudio.com/site/">Rachel</a>.</p>
<p>Like I said on the show: I’m going to be travelling during the second week in December. I’m not sure how well I’ll be able to keep up with comments, or if I’ll be able to queue up enough content to get us through. </p>
<p>Also, things may be disrupted a bit <em>this</em> week because I’m moving my home office.</p>
<p>My daughter Rachel moved out in early 2016. We left her room empty for a while, just in case she boomerang’d. But it’s been over half a year and she’s living stable, so I think she’s out for good. So we moved my son Issac into her room, and I’m taking Issac’s old room. This is a pretty big step for me. For two years I’ve been running this site from my living room where I’m constantly distracted by the television, guests, stuff going on in the kitchen, people playing music, people chattering on the phone, and a dozen other living-room things. But now I’m going to have my own room with a door.</p>
<p>That’s all good for the long-term, but in the short term it means tearing apart this gigantic command center of equipment and re-assembling it in another room. I know that’s bound to disrupt things around here, so please be patient if I’m worse than usual at moderating comments and answering emails.</p>
<p>Show notes:<span id="more-35660"></span><br>
<strong>0:00:33: Tablet Computer Q&amp;A</strong><br>
I’m looking for a machine that can let me create content and admin this site. At the same time, we really don’t have a lot of money right now, since we’re spending it on the trip. </p>
<p>On the show I said we were looking at a Surface 2 Pro. I was wrong. The model my wife suggested is the Microsoft Surface, which is currently under $150 and comes with a keyboard. (Compare to Surface 2, which is around double that without the keyboard.) The other wrinkle is that after the trip, I won’t really have use for either device. But if we get the Surface, my wife could use it for digital art. So Chromebook is cheaper but useless once the trip is over, while Surface is more expensive but potentially will continue to be useful after the trip. The best way I can think of to make this decision is to gather as much information as possible before choosing.</p>
<p>So, anyone have any general advice for these devices? Things to watch out for? Have you used a Surface, or a Chromebook? Sure, I can read random reviews, but I find our discussions here to be a lot more useful.</p>
<p><strong>0:09:36: <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2016/11/24/13743236/ubisoft-vivendi-takeover">Ubisoft exec says Vivendi takeover could “Damage culture of innovation.”</a></strong></p>
<p>I talked (snarked) about this on Twitter, and the response I got from a lot of people was “What about Child of Light and Valiant Hearts!?” as if I was being unfair. </p>
<p>Sure, once every few years Ubi puts out something experimental and different. But the vast bulk of their resources go into making a bunch of games that feel very similar and feel like design by focus group rather than having any sort of creative spark. It’s not that they never do anything interesting, it’s that claiming to have a “culture of innovation” is like saying that Batman has a “mirthful personality” because he’s gotten nailed by the Joker’s laughing gas a couple of times.</p>
<p><strong>0:25:38: Josh and the 3DS</strong></p>
<p><strong>0:42:55: Pokemon Sun &amp; Moon</strong></p>
<p>Having never played a Pokemon game, it’s amazing to me just how impenetrable this stuff gets. I think this is a good thing.

Like I said on the show: I’m going to be travelling during the second week in December. I’m not sure how well I’ll be able to keep up with comments, or if I’ll be able to queue up enough content to get us through.

Also, things may be disrupted a bit this week because I’m moving my home office.

My daughter Rachel moved out in early 2016. We left her room empty for a while, just in case she boomerang’d. But it’s been over half a year and she’s living stable, so I think she’s out for good. So we moved my son Issac into her room, and I’m taking Issac’s old room. This is a pretty big step for me. For two years I’ve been running this site from my living room where I’m constantly distracted by the television, guests, stuff going on in the kitchen, people playing music, people chattering on the phone, and a dozen other living-room things. But now I’m going to have my own room with a door.

That’s all good for the long-term, but in the short term it means tearing apart this gigantic command center of equipment and re-assembling it in another room. I know that’s bound to disrupt things around here, so please be patient if I’m worse than usual at moderating comments and answering emails.

Show notes:
0:00:33: Tablet Computer Q&amp;A
I’m looking for a machine that can let me create content and admin this site. At the same time, we really don’t have a lot of money right now, since we’re spending it on the trip.

On the show I said we were looking at a Surface 2 Pro. I was wrong. The model my wife suggested is the Microsoft Surface, which is currently under $150 and comes with a keyboard. (Compare to Surface 2, which is around double that without the keyboard.) The other wrinkle is that after the trip, I won’t really have use for either device. But if we get the Surface, my wife could use it for digital art. So Chromebook is cheaper but useless once the trip is over, while Surface is more expensive but potentially will continue to be useful after the trip. The best way I can think of to make this decision is to gather as much information as possible before choosing.

So, anyone have any general advice for these devices? Things to watch out for? Have you used a Surface, or a Chromebook? Sure, I can read random reviews, but I find our discussions here to be a lot more useful.

0:09:36: Ubisoft exec says Vivendi takeover could “Damage culture of innovation.”

I talked (snarked) about this on Twitter, and the response I got from a lot of people was “What about Child of Light and Valiant Hearts!?” as if I was being unfair.

Sure, once every few years Ubi puts out something experimental and different. But the vast bulk of their resources go into making a bunch of games that feel very similar and feel like design by focus group rather than having any sort of creative spark. It’s not that they never do anything interesting, it’s that claiming to have a “culture of innovation” is like saying that Batman has a “mirthful personality” because he’s gotten nailed by the Joker’s laughing gas a couple of times.

0:25:38: Josh and the 3DS

0:42:55: Pokemon Sun &amp; Moon

Having never played a Pokemon game, it’s amazing to me just how impenetrable this stuff gets. I think this is a good thing. It irritates me when people are dismissive towards Pokemon because the premise (capture animals and train them to fight) is simple. Mechanically, I’d say this game sounds pretty deep.

0:57:57: Physical Sales are down.

Stipulated: Discussing boxed sales and ignoring digital sales doesn’t paint a full picture of events. Having said that, this does make for an interesting collection of headlines:

Top 10 UK Sales Chart: Watch Dogs 2 Sales Down 80%
Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare Sales Fall 48% Compared to Black Ops 3
The Less Obvious Reason ‘Titanfall 2’ Might Be Failing
Call of Duty holds No.1 as Watch Dogs 2 launch sales fall 80% over the original

<p>Yay! It’s been too long since the last time we had a guest. Do check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI3GAJaOTL1BoipG41OmfyA">Bob’s YouTube channel</a>. Just pick something. You pretty much can’t go wrong. Although if pressed, I suppose <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZUynhkal1I">the Elder Scrolls</a> video is a good place to start. No wait. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJJaGSV75y0">Choice and Consequence</a> would be a better place to start.

<p><strong>0:20:01 The creative direction of BioWare</strong></p>
<p>We couldn’t very well NOT talk about this. So we talked about it. Or we tried to. We may have gotten distracted. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=em3u11X6r_g">Here is the video where Bob talks about Andromeda</a>. And here is the one about how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6TmTv6deTI">the company culture MUST change under EA</a>.</p>
<p><strong>0:27:30 If not BioWare, then who?</strong></p>
<p>This one is also for you folks in the comments. Where can we go for a classic-BioWare style fix these days? (Ignoring the fact that we all probably have different ideas on what “Classic BioWare” means.)</p>
<p><strong>0:42:05 Skyrim Remastered</strong></p>
<p>Okay, they took the original HD Pack textures and just literally scaled them up. So a 1024×1024 texture becomes 2048×2048. But that’s like enlarging a photograph. Making something bigger doesn’t ADD detail. Modern graphics cards already smooth rough pixel edges, so NOTHING is gained by doing this. They literally made the textures take up 4x as much memory for NO visual improvement. </p>
<p>They did add “god rays”, which is the effect where sun shafts will shine through tree branches, which is kind of cool if you happen to be in just the right spot and looking in the right direction at the right time of day in the right weather to see it. </p>
<p>They added new “water shaders” so now the rivers look like flowing streams of baby oil instead of water. But then to keep the download size down, they super-compressed the audio, which means the audio is lower quality than in the original. </p>
<p>What you end up with is a game that has worse audio, looks basically exactly the same, and costs $40. Oh, <em>Bethesda</em>.</p>

<strong>0:01:07: Star Trek: The Next Generation: The Commentary Track</strong></p>
<p>Note that I WAY overestimated how much audio / video content we’ve produced. Spoiler Warning channel has 780 videos with an average length of about half an hour, for a total of 390 hours of video. Then there’s about 200 hours of Diecast, assuming an average length of 1.2 hours each. That’s a lot, but where nowhere near the 1,000 hours I guessed during the show. </p>
<p>To reiterate what I said on the show: I’m spread too thin to do more projects. What I really <em>want</em> to do is make more Reset Button videos, but producing one video takes something like 20 hours, and I know I don’t have that many spare hours. </p>
<p>Josh is pitching an idea that might only take me 2 hours to produce. We’d watch an episode of Trek, make a commentary track, and then you could download it and play it along with the show. Josh’s idea has the advantage that it would take me 2 hours to produce 1 hour of content. This is opposed to an article, which might take 6 hours to produce 5 minutes of reading or a Reset Button video, where it would take 20 hours to make 10 minutes worth of content. </p>

Dear Diecast,
Which mailbag question do you really wish you’d answered at the time but is now embarrassingly out of date or irrelevant?

My curiosity is simply how the (regular) five of you all met up and decided to do all these podcasts and let’s plays and the such.

Here is the video in question.

Even allowing for the usual smoke-and-mirrors employed in these sorts of demos, it looks like the hard technology problems are solved.

0:45:32 – Sony sees the PC as a viable threat.

Here is the important quote, from Andrew House, head of Sony Interactive Entertainment:

[the data] suggested that there’s a dip mid-console lifecycle where the players who want the very best graphical experience will start to migrate to PC, because that’s obviously where it’s to be had. We wanted to keep those people within our eco-system by giving them the very best and very highest [performance quality]. So the net result of those thoughts was PlayStation 4 Pro – and, by and large, a graphical approach to game improvement.

<p>True story: I don’t touch-type. Considering that every single aspect of my job – writing columns, writing code, writing fiction, and writing emails to apologize for not answering emails sooner because I was playing videogames – involves <strong>typing</strong>, this is an embarrassing shortcoming. </p>
<p>See, by the time I got around to taking a touch-typing course in high school I’d already been typing for about five years. I found overcoming five years of muscle memory to be basically insurmountable. Making things worse is that many of the keyboards back then had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_MC-10">stupid layouts and odd sizes</a> that made it difficult to cultivate generalized typing habits.</p>
<p>So I type with the first three fingers on each hand, mostly while looking down at the keyboard. It’s ghastly slow compared to touch-typing, but the overhead of fixing it is just too costly. At this point I’ve got three decades of deeply ingrained habits that would all need to be broken. At my age, that sort of mental re-training is just not in the cards. </p>
<p>If I was going to invest time into something ambitious like that, I’d want to spend it on learning <strong>new</strong> things (like learning to play the guitar) rather than re-learning my core skills so that I can type faster. Especially since I’m not sure how much of a productivity boost it would give me. Typing speed isn’t always my primary bottleneck. For example, while writing this paragraph I paused at least three times to work out the next sentence. Boosting my typing speed might mean I’d just sit in this idle state for longer. </p>
<p>Still, typing like this is a little embarrassing. </p>

Dear Diecast
How come not a single one of the 24 spoiler warning games has been Japanese? I’m never gonna get a Deadly Premonition, Dragon’s Dogma or Metal Gear Rising Revengeance playthrough at this rate! Do I have to get Superbunnyhop on again to make this happen?

0:05:07: Zen Games

0:08:15: Mankind Divided

0:47:00: Looking Back: Josh discusses Deus Ex: Human Revolution: Director’s Cut

I think that’s probably the most colons I’ve ever had on one line. Anyway, Josh played through the previous game before diving in to Mankind Divided, and has some thoughts on returning to the game after so many years have passed.

For those that missed it here’s our coverage of the original cut of the game on Spoiler Warning:

This was the season where Campster joined the show. Time flies.

<p>Heads up: No <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/spoilerwarning/">Spoiler Warning</a> this week. But! Josh and Chris are working on something fun that might hold us over.</p>
<p>Show notes:<span id="more-33808"></span><br>
<strong>0:00:40: Looking ahead to the end of 2016.</strong></p>
<p>Looking back, it feels sort of like the <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=29624">Black Friday problem</a> I’ve talked about in the past. You want to release your games close to Christmas so that it’s there for gift-buyers. But then someone else does the same thing and you end up sharing the sales instead of dominating them. So you move the release date up a little bit to hit the shelves before them. But they get the same idea, and pretty soon everyone is fighting for October sales.</p>
<p><strong>0:03:10: VR</strong></p>
<p><strong>0:05:55: Battlefield VS. Titanfall</strong></p>
<p><strong>0:11:19: Gears of War 4</strong></p>
<p>During the show I said I didn’t care about Gears of War. I’ve actually been curious about the series for a long time and now that it’s coming to PC I might actually check it out. Although, not at launch-day prices.</p>
<p><strong>0:14:42: Civilization 6</strong></p>
<p>I’m really looking forward to picking this up so I can be bad at it and play it wrong.</p>
<p><strong>0:18:43: Dishonored 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>0:21:18: WATCH_DOGS 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>0:23:54: Final Fantasy 15</strong></p>
<p><strong>0:27:05: Star Trek Bridge Crew</strong></p>
<p>I keep getting this confused with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Bridge_Commander">Star Trek Bridge Commander</a>, which is a totally different game.</p>
<p><strong>0:30:30: Pokemon Go</strong></p>
<p>Here is the SuperBunnyHop video we mentioned, which talks about how Pokemon Go wasn’t something Nintendo planned. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>0:37:07: Inside</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>0:46:50: Quadralateral Cowboy</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>0:56:20: Human Revolution</strong></p>

<p>So I’m actually pretty ambivalent about this game so far. This is on top of the other problems we discussed in this episode, that this series has lost its way.</p>

Episode edited by Rachel.

Heads up: No Spoiler Warning this week. But! Josh and Chris are working on something fun that might hold us over.

Show notes:
0:00:40: Looking ahead to the end of 2016.

Looking back, it feels sort of like the Black Friday problem I’ve talked about in the past. You want to release your games close to Christmas so that it’s there for gift-buyers. But then someone else does the same thing and you end up sharing the sales instead of dominating them. So you move the release date up a little bit to hit the shelves before them. But they get the same idea, and pretty soon everyone is fighting for October sales.

0:03:10: VR

0:05:55: Battlefield VS. Titanfall

0:11:19: Gears of War 4

During the show I said I didn’t care about Gears of War. I’ve actually been curious about the series for a long time and now that it’s coming to PC I might actually check it out. Although, not at launch-day prices.

0:14:42: Civilization 6

I’m really looking forward to picking this up so I can be bad at it and play it wrong.

0:18:43: Dishonored 2

0:21:18: WATCH_DOGS 2

0:23:54: Final Fantasy 15

0:27:05: Star Trek Bridge Crew

I keep getting this confused with Star Trek Bridge Commander, which is a totally different game.

0:30:30: Pokemon Go

Here is the SuperBunnyHop video we mentioned, which talks about how Pokemon Go wasn’t something Nintendo planned.

0:37:07: Inside

0:46:50: Quadralateral Cowboy

0:56:20: Human Revolution

I am NOT looking forward to this game. I found the whole AUGS LIVES MATTER controversy to be really off-puttingAND ALSO GRAMMATICALLY INCORRECT. It should be “AUG LIVES MATTER”.. Not because the topic is too taboo (or whatever) to appear in a videogame, but because it was so clumsy, on-the-nose, and heavy-handed about it. Sure, you COULD use this topic as a great starting point for a story, but I have zero faith that it will be handled with the thoughtful nuance it deserves. I fully expect to be:

Launched out of the game by on-the-nose, immersion-breaking references to Current Events.
Irritated if the game casts my viewpoint as the Bad Guys.
Embarrassed if they cast my side as the Good Guys.
Frustrated if they use a topic as decoration but refuse to actually define it or integrate it with the world. (Like synths in Fallout 4.)

So I’m actually pretty ambivalent about this game so far. This is on top of the other problems we discussed in this episode, that this series has lost its way.

I SHOULDN’T NEED TO SAY THIS BUT I WILL: This is not the place to talk about Black Lives Matter. We can talk about hijacking existing controversy as a marketing ploy, or using current events as setting flavor, but let’s leave the particulars of BLM out of it. If you see someone go too far, please for my sake let it slide and let me handle it. I’ll do my best to keep this stress-free for all of us.

<p><strong>00:02:58: No Man’s Sky</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A day after recording this, and my experience with the game continues to improve. People sometimes mock Final Fantasy games for having the problem of “It gets good after ten hours”, because ten hours of lousy gaming is still ten hours you’d rather spend on a fun game. When I say “It gets good later” it’s not because I’m trying to talk you into buying the game. I’m just sharing my experience. </p>
<p>It’s hard to recommend this game, because while it’s a very unique and novel experience, the price tag is kind of high. $60 is a big gamble on an unknown like this. </p>
<p><strong>01:03:27: Rutskan Tries His Hand at Coding Text Adventure</strong> </p>

<p>Like I said in the show intro, I’m working on adding the podcast to Google Play and (eventually) to iTunes. While this is going on, the post will be a little wonky. (For example, as of right now there are two media players on this page, although if you’re reading this from the archives in the future then I’ve hopefully fixed it by now.) Please bear with us. <a href="https://play.google.com/music/listen#/ps/I26tzdf7n6acqbddz367qqjbopa">Here is the podcast on Google Play</a> and here is a link to the GP <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?feed=podcast">RSS feed</a>.</p>

<p><strong>1:00: We compare Chris to Strong Sad.</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t know anything about Homestar Runner, then this video probably won’t even begin to help you to have an inkling of an iota of a notion of what you’re missing. But it’s got Strong Sad in it, and that’s what’s important for the purposes of our discussion.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>4:05: Diecast on Google Play and iTunes.</strong></p>
<p>To submit to Google Play / iTunes, you need a custom RSS feed with their company-specific special-snowflake tags added. Assuming you have better things to do than manually generate your own RSS feed (or write and maintain integrated WordPress plugins to do same) then this means using an existing WordPress plugin. The one I’m using is the best I found. (Read: Simplest to enable and roll out on an existing site. Most plugins seem to be written with the assumption that your blog BRAND NEW and ONLY for the podcast and thus everything should be added to the RSS feed.) But this one comes with its own player and problems and frustrations. </p>
<p>Anyway. If you’re a Google Play user then please let me know if it works like it should. If you have any advice for adding the show to iTunes without needing to install stupid iTunes on my PC, I’d love to hear it. If not, then it sounds like Mumbles can take care of it.</p>
<p>I’m asking this on the show because I don’t use RSS, I don’t listen to podcasts, I don’t use Google Play, and I don’t do very much with mobile devices, so there’s no way I’ll know if I’ve gotten it wrong.</p>
<p><strong>7:55: Star Trek Beyond</strong></p>
<p>Here’s the Twitter fit I threw last year when the first trailer came out, along with the trailer in question:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Okay, which one of you swaggering Gorn-faced morons asked Hollywood to turn Trek into Fast and the Furious in space?<a href="https://t.co/POWqQC5XCS">https://t.co/POWqQC5XCS</a></p>

<p></p>
<p>But like I said in some follow-up tweets, I’ve long since made peace with the fact that Trek movies are just action films now. I’m okay with that as long as they’re GOOD. (Which both Josh and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nfEprhrXGQ">Moviebob</a> say this one is.)</p>
<p><strong>25:48: Suicide Squad</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>16:01 FTL has been updated and is more interesting now.</strong></p>
<p>To clarify: The update is “new” in the sense of being new to me. It was actually released ages ago. (A couple of years, according to the comments.)</p>
<p><strong>20:40 Josh goes on a rant about Adobe products and their bone-headed keymapping feature.</strong></p>
<p><strong>24:00 Scary games / Not Scary Games</strong></p>
<p><strong>33:19 Starbound</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>52:34 Mailbag: Rutskarn’s made-up internet name.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Rutskarn,</p>
<p>What is the proper pronunciation of your name?  Your fellow casters call you Rut-skarn (or Butt-skarn) but when you introduce yourself when hosting you say Root-skarn.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br>
Jared</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>53:54 Mailbag: Details vs. Drama</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Shamus/Diecast, </p>
<p>In your Mass Effect Retrospective, you discussed details-first vs drama-first storytelling. However, you only spoke of this topic within sci-fi settings. Is it possible to tell a details-first fantasy story?</p>
<p>Thank you,<br>
Steven </p></blockquote>

Show notes:1:54 Death Road to Canada

16:01 FTL has been updated and is more interesting now.

To clarify: The update is “new” in the sense of being new to me. It was actually released ages ago. (A couple of years, according to the comments.)

20:40 Josh goes on a rant about Adobe products and their bone-headed keymapping feature.

24:00 Scary games / Not Scary Games

33:19 Starbound

52:34 Mailbag: Rutskarn’s made-up internet name.

Dear Rutskarn,
What is the proper pronunciation of your name?  Your fellow casters call you Rut-skarn (or Butt-skarn) but when you introduce yourself when hosting you say Root-skarn.
Best Regards,
Jared

53:54 Mailbag: Details vs. Drama

Dear Shamus/Diecast,
In your Mass Effect Retrospective, you discussed details-first vs drama-first storytelling. However, you only spoke of this topic within sci-fi settings. Is it possible to tell a details-first fantasy story?
Thank you,
Steven

Ardyvee ‏@Ardyvee 1m1 minute ago
@nicemovemumbles have there been cases where you guys didn’t review a game because it was “too old”? If so, which game?

I’m a big believer that this should be the main thrust of Rutskarn’s Patreon. His best content is when he’s trapped in some unbearable ancient game that barely ran even on its intended hardware where – after hours of tears and confusion when he finally overcomes the game’s broken systems by pitting them against its glitches – once he beats the game nobody will care because nobody even remembers it. Basically, if we can just keep him doing that forever and ever I’ll be happy.

<p>Since I asked for recommendations, I guess I should make clear what I’m looking for in a Match-3 game: 1) Focus on planning ahead and setting up deliberate moves. 2) NO TIMER. I like working with a limited number of moves, but being allowed to consider those moves for as long as I like. 3) Ideally, there would be some sort of meta-game. 4) Preferably something without naked anime girls.</p>
<p>Also, this discusses quasi-pornography. I’d encourage everyone to be respectful. Remember that one person’s “tame cheesecake” is another person’s “sick filth”. We’re all coming from different backgrounds and cultures and have different expectations. This is one of those topics that seem to flip everyone’s jerk switch. Try not to be crappy to each other. </p>
<p>Also, I’d like to say how happy I am that I can use the phrase “naked anime girls” without worrying that the Google smut-bot is going to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10caMf8ZRX8">throw a fit</a>. </p>

<p>This is what we saw at E3:</p>

<p></p>
<p>I’ve watched some gameplay on YouTube since then, and it looks very different. It’s much more about gathering resources and weapons and less about having your head messed with.

Dear Diecast,

33:36 Mailbag: Fallout 4 Survival

Greetings Rutskarn, Shamus, Campster, Mumbles etc
Have any of you tried the new survival mode for Fallout 4, if so, what are your thoughts?
-A

44:44 Mailbag: The Silmarillion

Hello Diecast!
Shamus, you are the foremost expert on the Lord or The Rings, judging by how eloquently you analyze it as well as by how many copies of the book you have used up over the years.
Have you read any of the other Middle-Earth material, like the Silmarillion or the Short Stories? If so, how do they compare to the Hobbit and LOTR?
Regards,
Matthias

47:30 Mailbag: Violence

Dear Diecast,
What do you think of the fact that violence, usually killing and being killed, is the primary way the player interacts with the universe in most games, and do you think that has had any spillover effect on other media?
I kept wondering about that after finally seeing the new Star Wars and being bugged by how many people the heroes kill onscreen, as opposed to being in far-off explosions or the camera cutting away before the killing blow, like what happens with most of the villains’ kills.  The amount of points where the protagonists are stuck in a place where they just have to kill everybody else in the area to proceed just felt like a videogame.
Sincerely, Michael.

My answer:

57:22 Mailbag: First Edition D&amp;D

Dear Diecast,
Rutskarn’s discussions of second edition AD&amp;D and its eccentricities reveals to me one fundamental fact:  he has never delved deep into first edition AD&amp;D.  Perhaps he could be challenged to write a series, or even just a post, based upon a reading of the 1st edition Dungeon Masters’ Guide?  It would be highly entertaining.
Sincerely,
Dan

<strong>01:08 Shamus is up for a Hugo Award</strong></p>
<p>Here I talk about the fact that <a href="http://midamericon2.org/home/hugo-awards-and-wsfs/2016-hugo-finalists/">I’ve been nominated for a Hugo</a>, and I briefly mention the controversy the Hugos have been having for the past two years. I don’t want to talk about the controversy here. In fact, the <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=31891">no politics post</a> was written specifically in anticipation of this discussion. </p>
<p>If you’re looking for more information: On WIRED there’s this post entitled <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/10/hugo-awards-controversy/">Sci-Fi’s Hugo Awards and the Battle for Pop Culture’s Soul</a>, which seems to be the one everyone links when trying to bring people up to speed on this. However, like a lot of Wired articles this one feels like the author was paid by the word. It’s long on anecdotes, it takes forever to get to the point, it’s broad and hyperbolic, and for all the words it spends it never feels like it gets down to details. </p>
<p>I found this one much more useful: <a href="https://www.blackgate.com/2015/04/04/a-detailed-explanation/">A Detailed Explanation</a> by Matthew David Surridge, explaining why he declined his Hugo nomination last year. It is also long – I’m afraid you can’t really do the topic justice in a couple of paragraphs – but instead of spending its word count on stories, he just takes up one side and argues for it. In the process he kind of maps out a good deal of both sides<span class="snote" title="1">Calling it “both sides” is something of a misnomer. There are a lot more than two viewpoints here, and you can’t really fame it as two clear-cut groups without making simplifications and generalizations that will very likely piss some people off.</span>. </p>
<p>I’m excited to be nominated for a Hugo. I’m excited that videogames are being recognized and encouraged in their pursuit of sci-fi stories. I’m dreading dealing with people who don’t respect my no politics rule and are just looking for an opportunity to unleash the anger they’re hauling around. I think accepting the nomination is the most diplomatic thing to do, and win or lose I’m grateful for everyone who thinks my work has merit.</p>
<p><strong>11:18 Fallout Mods.</strong></p>
<p>It’s pretty hard to discuss the Fallout modding scene without slipping into yet another enumeration of the shortcomings of Fallout 4. We tried.</p>
<p><strong>29:45 Mailbag: Sc-fi is sometimes hard.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Dice Wizards,</p>
<p>Writers often create characters, species, or races lacking some essential part of what makes us human, ie. no emotions, sense of pain, fear of death, no body in the sense that we think of it, individuality, sexual desire, etc.</p>
<p>Since these characters often still tend to think and act like humans do, do you think writers and actors, as regular lifelong humans, are any good at imagining and portraying beings that lack important parts of what drives our thoughts and actions?</p>
<p>Thanks.<br>
Jakale</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>50:31 Mailbag: What would YOU do with an $80 million game budget?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>A hypothetical AAA entity who likes The Diecast offers to put you (the collective crew of the Diecast) in charge of a AAA game with a budget of, let’s say, 80 million USD. Let’s pretend you have full creative control and that you accept the offer (though whether you would is also an interesting question). What do you make? To what degree do you play it safe or push the envelope? How do you allocate your resources?</p>
<p>Live long &amp; prosper,</p>
<p>Erich T. Wade</p></blockquote>
<p>I have to give Erich credit for a well-constructed question. This setup anticipated all the ways in which we would attempt to weasel out of answering it.</p>
<p><strong>1:00:50 Mailbag: EA Convention</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>A while back, Shamus and Josh were talking about how EA and somebody else weren’t having E3 booths any more because it wasn’t worth the expense for them. </p>
<p>Rather than having a presence at a general game show like E3 or a PAX, do you think it would make sense for somebody like EA to run their own show, Blizzcon-style?</p>

If you’re looking for more information: On WIRED there’s this post entitled Sci-Fi’s Hugo Awards and the Battle for Pop Culture’s Soul, which seems to be the one everyone links when trying to bring people up to speed on this. However, like a lot of Wired articles this one feels like the author was paid by the word. It’s long on anecdotes, it takes forever to get to the point, it’s broad and hyperbolic, and for all the words it spends it never feels like it gets down to details.

I found this one much more useful: A Detailed Explanation by Matthew David Surridge, explaining why he declined his Hugo nomination last year. It is also long – I’m afraid you can’t really do the topic justice in a couple of paragraphs – but instead of spending its word count on stories, he just takes up one side and argues for it. In the process he kind of maps out a good deal of both sidesCalling it “both sides” is something of a misnomer. There are a lot more than two viewpoints here, and you can’t really fame it as two clear-cut groups without making simplifications and generalizations that will very likely piss some people off..

I’m excited to be nominated for a Hugo. I’m excited that videogames are being recognized and encouraged in their pursuit of sci-fi stories. I’m dreading dealing with people who don’t respect my no politics rule and are just looking for an opportunity to unleash the anger they’re hauling around. I think accepting the nomination is the most diplomatic thing to do, and win or lose I’m grateful for everyone who thinks my work has merit.

11:18 Fallout Mods.

It’s pretty hard to discuss the Fallout modding scene without slipping into yet another enumeration of the shortcomings of Fallout 4. We tried.

29:45 Mailbag: Sc-fi is sometimes hard.

Dear Dice Wizards,
Writers often create characters, species, or races lacking some essential part of what makes us human, ie. no emotions, sense of pain, fear of death, no body in the sense that we think of it, individuality, sexual desire, etc.
Since these characters often still tend to think and act like humans do, do you think writers and actors, as regular lifelong humans, are any good at imagining and portraying beings that lack important parts of what drives our thoughts and actions?
Thanks.
Jakale

50:31 Mailbag: What would YOU do with an $80 million game budget?

A hypothetical AAA entity who likes The Diecast offers to put you (the collective crew of the Diecast) in charge of a AAA game with a budget of, let’s say, 80 million USD. Let’s pretend you have full creative control and that you accept the offer (though whether you would is also an interesting question). What do you make? To what degree do you play it safe or push the envelope? How do you allocate your resources?
Live long &amp; prosper,
Erich T. Wade

I have to give Erich credit for a well-constructed question. This setup anticipated all the ways in which we would attempt to weasel out of answering it.

1:00:50 Mailbag: EA Convention

A while back, Shamus and Josh were talking about how EA and somebody else weren’t having E3 booths any more because it wasn’t worth the expense for them.
Rather than having a presence at a general game show like E3 or a PAX, do you think it would make sense for somebody like EA to run their own show, Blizzcon-style?

The cast barely discusses the movie. Most of the time is spent talking about the DC universe and the creative people involved. But once in a while the conversation circles back to drop a huge spoiler.

57:05 LA Noire

<p>Last week there was a bit of controversy <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=31309">on Spoiler Warning</a>. If you don’t watch the show or don’t read the comments then you probably won’t have the context for this. Basically, Mumbles made some jokes about torturing robots, some other people objected, and then Mumbles recorded this:</p>
<p>During the show, when she said she was sick of the female coach character, it hit on something I’d been thinking about for weeks, which was the series of design decisions that led to this trope. So as she commented on it, I reflexively went, “Oh, here’s a segue into that thing I’ve been thinking about!” So then I tried to talk about it on the spot, and halfway into it I realized it was too big and complicated to cover on the show<span class="snote" title="1">This actually happens pretty often. I should rename my column, “Random Shit That Didn’t Fit on Spoiler Warning.”</span>. I ended up turning it into <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=31376">my weekly column</a>. But then that dumped even more aggro on Mumbles. (Sorry Mumbles.)</p>
<p>Hopefully this clears everything up and puts the controversy to rest. This is supposed to be fun.</p>

<span id="more-31032"></span><strong>00:01:00 Microsoft and Windows 10 Store Shenanigans</strong></p>
<p>Here is Tim Sweeny, literally <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/04/microsoft-monopolise-pc-games-development-epic-games-gears-of-war">calling on people to fight the Microsoft initiative</a>. If there’s one critique I have for Sweeny, it’s that I think bringing up the Microsoft antitrust lawsuit is a mistake in this context. That case was really complex and doesn’t come off as the scathing condemnation he intends it to. If you’re trying to persuade an undecided audience to join your cause, doing so under a controversial banner only limits your reach. If you’re arguing tax policy, don’t try to bolster your argument with arguments that require the reader agree with you on (say) abortion. You’re just going to thread-jack your own argument, and people will debate the controversial thing instead of examining the new thing you’re trying to get them to care about. </p>
<p>For example, now that I’ve mentioned the antitrust suit, people are going to be tempted to bring it up here, so I need to head them off with this: <em>This is not about the [lack of?] merit of the antitrust lawsuit and if you try to argue about it here you are the debate equivalent of a cat chasing a laser pointer. Let’s keep the conversation focused on Microsoft’s shenanigans in 2016.</em></p>
<p>I think you can make a really good case against UWP on simple practical grounds as a consumer, and that doesn’t require agreement on the antitrust case, which was a debate that took thousands of different viewpoints and tried to shove them into simple boxes labeled “for” and “against”. </p>
<p>Also, since we mentioned Jill of the Jungle, I have to link to this. I fell in love with this game back in the day, despite the fact that I don’t really enjoy 2D sidescrolling platformers. This game won me over with presentation and soundtrack. (Mostly soundtrack.)</p>

<p>As we recorded this, Mumbles was getting over being sick. And while I didn’t know it at the time, I was just a few hours from becoming annoyingly sick myself. </p>
<p>Show notes: <span id="more-30875"></span></p>
<p><strong>00:02:00: Oxenfree</strong></p>
<p>Mild spoilers. Mumbles says somethign vague about the ending or whatever.<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here is <a href="http://digitalmumbles.com/2016/02/24/oxenfree-soundtrack/">the post Mumbles did about the Oxenfree soundtrack</a>.</p>
<p><strong>00:11:30: Devil Daggers</strong></p>
<p>I don’t think this trailer really sells the game all that well. It’s much more hectic than what you see here:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

As we recorded this, Mumbles was getting over being sick. And while I didn’t know it at the time, I was just a few hours from becoming annoyingly sick myself.

Show notes:

00:02:00: Oxenfree

Mild spoilers. Mumbles says somethign vague about the ending or whatever.

Here is the post Mumbles did about the Oxenfree soundtrack.

00:11:30: Devil Daggers

I don’t think this trailer really sells the game all that well. It’s much more hectic than what you see here:

Spoiler: Here is the video that ruined the game for me. It’s someone playing for 8 minutes. Once I saw that, I kind of felt like my own one-minute scores were too sad to continue working on.

00:19:30: Star Wars Novel: Lost Stars

Here is a link to the book on GoodReads.

00:24:45: X-Com 2

00:28:30: Josh got a mechanical keyboard.

We compared keyboards in the diecast. For the record, here is mine in rainbow mode:

You can also see the purple Halloween lights I have strung around under my desk, in case you thought I was kidding when I talked about that on Spoiler Warning.

00:34:15: Shamus goes on a strange digression about raging out.

Sorry for interrupting Josh’s keyboard talk. I know this feels kind of out of place on the show. This is something I’ve wanted to write about for ages, but… didn’t. So then the subject came up and I couldn’t help talking about it.

00:38:42: Do bad games make good games better?

Dear Diecast,
So I have actually kinda cathartically enjoyed a couple different critiques on Bethesda’s Fallout 4. Its a really fun problem to have, since the issues Bethesda has introduced seem to be based on huge misunderstanding of the franchise. But in a way it also does shine a light on the games that did understand its franchise right, and thats what I wanted to know about. Do franchises benefit from having a few bad apples, in order to make the other works feel more special. Is that why we cherish New Vegas as a return to form? Are there any other franchises that have benefitted from having bad works? I think Star Wars could be one.
Questionably,
James

00:49:02: Extemporaneous self-insert surprise question!

Dear Diecast,
Can you think of any games that broke from their old style and were just as good (or better for it) after being re-invented.
You have the best podcast ever,

<p>Yes, the topics for this week look a lot like the topics for last week, but I promise this is a new episode.</p>
<p>We haven’t kept careful track of episode lengths, but I’m pretty sure that sometime in the last few weeks we reached the point where there is now a full week of Diecast.  That is, it would take a full week of continuous listening to play through the whole show. </p>
<p>Show notes:<span id="more-30591"></span><br>
<strong>00:00:55: Tomb Raider</strong></p>
<p>I start off announcing that we’re going to spoil everything, and then… I’m not sure if we do? Certainly nothing major.</p>
<p><strong>00:18:26: Tomb Raider (Spoilers)</strong></p>
<p>Once again I declare a live-fire exercise with regards to spoilers, and once again we don’t really reveal much.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that the game is very trope-driven and very little in the story should surprise you. And the things that do surprise you aren’t delightful surprises, but rather head scratchers like, “Really? That dude is here? I thought he exited the story hours ago. Oh well. That’s nice I guess.”</p>
<p><strong>00:25:24: Massive Chalice</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>00:34:16: The Witness</strong>   </p>
<p>No spoilers here. I’m not even sure you can spoil this game. Spoiling it would require understanding what’s going on at some level, and I’m at no risk of that happening.</p>
<p><strong>00:52:48: Mailbag</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Josh,</p>
<p>Did you ever figure out to use PB Blaster for your plumbing problem? What have you been cooking recently? When will we hear more exploits from the Everyday Life of Josh Viel?</p>

We haven’t kept careful track of episode lengths, but I’m pretty sure that sometime in the last few weeks we reached the point where there is now a full week of Diecast.  That is, it would take a full week of continuous listening to play through the whole show.

Show notes:
00:00:55: Tomb Raider

I start off announcing that we’re going to spoil everything, and then… I’m not sure if we do? Certainly nothing major.

00:18:26: Tomb Raider (Spoilers)

Once again I declare a live-fire exercise with regards to spoilers, and once again we don’t really reveal much.

Part of the problem is that the game is very trope-driven and very little in the story should surprise you. And the things that do surprise you aren’t delightful surprises, but rather head scratchers like, “Really? That dude is here? I thought he exited the story hours ago. Oh well. That’s nice I guess.”

00:25:24: Massive Chalice

00:34:16: The Witness

No spoilers here. I’m not even sure you can spoil this game. Spoiling it would require understanding what’s going on at some level, and I’m at no risk of that happening.

00:52:48: Mailbag

Dear Josh,
Did you ever figure out to use PB Blaster for your plumbing problem? What have you been cooking recently? When will we hear more exploits from the Everyday Life of Josh Viel?
My apologies to everyone else,
Funklewrinkler

00:53:56: Mailbag

Dear Spoilers,
Has doing Spoiler Warning changed the way you look at video games as a whole? If so, howz?
Sincerely,
Funklewrinkler

<p>It’s not that the story sucks, it’s that it gets too much focus. These mechanics are really strong, and I think the game should be more confident about leaving us to enjoy them for longer. Also, like I said the other day:</p>

<p>Having played a few more hours now, I’m pretty sure it’s a magical glowstick that turns itself off if there are dudes in the zone. It’s still bananas, but it’s a different kind of bananas than I first assumed.</p>

<p>The show is late. There are no show notes. I am not in this episode.

<p>Since I wasn’t in the show, I put my thoughts in the show notes below.</p>
<p>Show notes:<span id="more-30199"></span><br>
<strong>1:00: Powerball</strong></p>
<p>For the curious: I’ve never bought a lottery ticket of any kind in my whole life. Having said that, I’m not one of those people who likes to mock people for playing the lottery. It’s just that my gambling takes a different form. Instead of wasting a couple of dollars for an <em>extremely</em> astronomical chance at success, I risk hundreds or thousands of hours of my life on projects (books, comics, game development) for a <em>mildly</em> astronomical chance at success. Who is the bigger dumbass? I don’t think it’s that clear-cut. </p>
<p>And like a lottery player, I don’t play because I expect to win. I play because I enjoy the experience of playing. Although now that I have <a href="https://www.patreon.com/shamusyoung?ty=h">Patreon</a> it feels less like a random gamble and more like a sane investment. </p>
<p>So, thanks, by the way. </p>
<p><strong>3:08: Oculus Rift</strong></p>
<p>My column this week will discuss this.</p>
<p><strong>21:35: Amplitude</strong></p>
<p>It’s only recently that I became aware of how horrible I am at multi-tasking. I can’t listen and do something at the same time. If I’m playing a game, I have to pause. Earlier in our marriage I overestimated my multitasking capacity. I’d try to listen and play at the same time, and end up doing that “half listening” thing. Something like:</p>
<p>Heather: I’m going to the store. I left a cake in the oven. Can you take it out in twenty minutes?</p>
<p>Me: (Pause for several seconds, staring fixedly at the screen.) Yeah. Cake. Twenty minutes.</p>
<p>And then later she comes home and the cake is a brick of carbon. She asks me about it, and I barely remember the earlier conversation at all.</p>
<p>This is why I don’t stream, even though that would be a fun thing to do. A Shamus Twitch Stream would just be me playing, mostly in silence. Once in  a while I’d say something like, “I like fighting these…. shit. (pause.) These skeleton guys are interesting bec- shit. Hang on. (Five minutes of silence.) So anyway… the… skeleton guys… are very… interesting because… <em>Oh shit that was a lot of XP.</em> because… they… the skeletons, I mean… they’re interesting when you… aw damn it!  When you have, like… When you’re fighting them but you also…”</p>
<p>Yeah. It wouldn’t be entertaining. I actually have to concentrate really hard when I listen and speak, which probably explains why my social development <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=12853">lagged so far behind other kids</a>.</p>

This week we have a TOTAL SPOILER discussion on the new Star Wars. Turn back or have the movie spoiled. This means you, fanboy. Seriously, I drop the biggest spoiler of the whole movie right at the 40-minute mark as I introduce the topic.

Let’s just assume the comments will be spoiler-heavy, too.

Mumbles and Rutskarn haven’t done their end-of-year thing yet, so this week is their chance. Find out what they thought of 2015.

00:01:16: OMG Steampocalypse 2015!!11

00:08:56: Rutskarn and Mumbles talk about 2015.

They start with Undertale.

00:14:42: Pillars of Eternity
00:14:51: Arkham Knight
00:17:54: Fallout 4
00:20:25: Hotline Miami 2
00:21:51: Tony Hawk
00:22:59: Skylanders
00:26:11: The Beginners Guide
00:27:09: Fallout 4 again for some reason?

<p>No Star Wars talk this week. It’s a little too soon. But I suspect next week will be the big spoiler discussion. Be ready!</p>

<p><strong>00:00:45: Disney Land vs. Disney World</strong></p>
<p>Mumbles went on her honeymoon last week, and she went to Disney Land / World. I said I didn’t know the difference. So she explained. </p>
<p>I <em>still</em> don’t know the difference. She tried.</p>
<p><strong>00:29:51: Voice acting and realism</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast:</p>
<p>Though Dark Souls is known for being hard, it is also known for its aesthetic. One aspect where I really appreciated the attention to detail was in the voice acting for the player character: In most games, when the player character gets hurt, you hear a fairly unbelieveable “ouch” or “oof” just to alert you, but Dark Souls makes it sound like your character is really in pain! (Particularly if you choose a female character)</p>
<p>Do you think other games are as deliberate about not doing what Dark Souls is deliberate about doing? Obviously we don’t want to be seriously concerned about, say, Mario’s wellbeing when he touches a goomba, but in the endless supply of World War 2 shooters, the voice acting is suprisingly lacking. Is this an example of most games failing to be realistic, or an example where we really shouldn’t have realism as a goal?</p>

<p>This month is likely to be spotty, in terms of podcasts and videos. It’s hard enough to get all five of us together at the same time on a normal week, and now it’s the silly season. Everyone has a party to go to. Or get ready for. Or recover from. So I don’t know what we’ll be getting, content-wise. </p>
<p>Show notes: <span id="more-29753"></span><br>
<strong>00:01:00 Star Wars Battlefront</strong></p>
<p><strong>00:20:40 Far Cry Primal</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Having watched the trailer, I gotta say this looks a lot more interesting to me than anything previously appearing under the Far Cry label. My only misgiving is that it’s an Ubisoft game, which means tedious repetition. And also Uplay. Ew.</p>
<p><strong>00:32:31 Before</strong></p>
<p><strong>00:33:33 Psychonauts 2 and fig</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Huh. The re-release of Psychonauts sold double the copies of the original run? Where are the idiots who couldn’t be bothered to give permission to re-release No One Lives Forever? They need to see this. Jerks.</p>
<p><strong>00::54:12 MAILTIME – Screen resolution.</strong> </p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecasters</p>
<p>How important is screen resolution for games, in terms of how things look versus the performance costs? Are we going to hit a point where resolutions stop increasing, or it’s not worth designing games to work well with higher resolutions any time soon?</p>
<p>Zagzag</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>01:04:46 Spooky Games</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Today I was talking to Horror Games and her cousin Spooky Games at lunch ingestion period, and she mentioned that some of you people are good at dealing with being around them. Personally I can’t be around Horror or even Spooky for more than a short while before my nerves give out. I really like them, and want to freak out less when we spend time together. What’s the secret(s)?</p>
<p>With love,<br>

This week there won’t be any Spoiler Warning. But! You get a longer-than-usual Diecast, and if we’re all really good maybe Josh will upload last week’s hangout to YouTube.

This month is likely to be spotty, in terms of podcasts and videos. It’s hard enough to get all five of us together at the same time on a normal week, and now it’s the silly season. Everyone has a party to go to. Or get ready for. Or recover from. So I don’t know what we’ll be getting, content-wise.

Show notes:
00:01:00 Star Wars Battlefront

00:20:40 Far Cry Primal

Having watched the trailer, I gotta say this looks a lot more interesting to me than anything previously appearing under the Far Cry label. My only misgiving is that it’s an Ubisoft game, which means tedious repetition. And also Uplay. Ew.

00:32:31 Before

00:33:33 Psychonauts 2 and fig

Huh. The re-release of Psychonauts sold double the copies of the original run? Where are the idiots who couldn’t be bothered to give permission to re-release No One Lives Forever? They need to see this. Jerks.

00::54:12 MAILTIME – Screen resolution.

Dear Diecasters
How important is screen resolution for games, in terms of how things look versus the performance costs? Are we going to hit a point where resolutions stop increasing, or it’s not worth designing games to work well with higher resolutions any time soon?
Zagzag

01:04:46 Spooky Games

Dear Diecast,
Today I was talking to Horror Games and her cousin Spooky Games at lunch ingestion period, and she mentioned that some of you people are good at dealing with being around them. Personally I can’t be around Horror or even Spooky for more than a short while before my nerves give out. I really like them, and want to freak out less when we spend time together. What’s the secret(s)?
With love,
Fellow Education System Inmate #Ira

<p>Yes. Another entire hour of Fallout 4 talk. I suppose this is annoying if you don’t care about Fallout 4, but we can’t talk about games we’re not playing and right now this is what everyone is playing. This time we get to hear from Rutskarn and Mumbles.</p>

<p>Whoops. Rachel left about four minutes of dead air on the tail end of the podcast.

<p>I’d like to temper my commentary on the game a little. Yesterday on Twitter I said:</p>

<p></p>
<p>I think rather than being the “best of both games”, it’s more like we finally got a game that avoids the crippling <em>failures</em> of both. It might sound like I’m splitting hairs, but bear with me. I think this is an important distinction.</p>
<p>Fallout 4 gets pretty schlocky in parts, but it’s not the brain-melting idiocy of Fallout 3.

<p>So I shouldn’t have implied this is the <em>best</em> of the bunch. More like it’s the one with the <em>least severe flaws</em>. The whole product seems to be converging on a point of adequacy. </p>

<p></p>
<p>I actually worry a lot about negativity. I don’t want to be known as That One Guy Who Hates Everything. Also, red-faced nerdrage attracts a more… energetic audience. While stuff like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFD2293oGvA">MovieBob’s ten-minute evisceration of Pixels</a> is insanely popular, it’s not the kind of thing I’d want to be known for.

<p>But on the other hand, it’s pretty hard to have an all-positive show all the time. I have no idea how to make one. Explaining why something doesn’t work is usually a lot more complex than explaining why it does, so negative topics are usually more interesting. The Activision topic is a good example. If Activision did something ordinary and financially sound, then what would be the point of discussing it? Why bring it up? This isn’t a news show, it’s a commentary show. </p>
<p>What I’m getting at is: I love positive content and upbeat personalities. If given the choice, that’s the kind of space I’d prefer to occupy. But the engineer in me wants to troubleshoot problems. This site is basically the balance between those two opposing forces. </p>

Ammo seems to be at most just a hindrance to having fun.</p>
<p>My question is, are there any games that make ammo fun, if not, is there a way to make ammo a fun mechanic, or should ammo go the way of health in modern shooters, and just regenerate over time?</p></blockquote>

Dear Diecast,

39:15 Mailbag: Fun ammo!

Dear Diecast,
Limited ammunition is one of the most common mechanics in video games, but it’s never seemed that interesting to me.  It’s only ever used to gate off certain weapons from use by not providing ammo for them, or to provide tension when the player has very little ammo left, but if you ever run out of all your ammo, then you just can’t play anymore.  Ammo seems to be at most just a hindrance to having fun.
My question is, are there any games that make ammo fun, if not, is there a way to make ammo a fun mechanic, or should ammo go the way of health in modern shooters, and just regenerate over time?

<strong>00:46 Human Resource Machine.</strong></p>
<p>Update: On the show I said I wanted to see how a non-coder would take to this game. I got it for <a href="http://www.blueberrystarstudio.com/">Rachel</a> last night, and she’s plowing through it. So it’s totally playable for people who have never coded before. Although now that I think of it, Rachel has done fairly extensive work with Minecraft command blocks, which probably gave her a good starting framework. Still, I think I can recommend this game unconditionally for both coders and non-coders. Which is pretty amazing. </p>
<p>I’ll probably have a follow-up post on this at some point to ask what people thought of it. </p>
<p><strong>13:02 Left-handed people and video games.</strong></p>
<p>Fun trivia: The Diecast is 40% left-handers. (Mumbles and Chris.)</p>
<p><strong>25:46 Mass Effect 3: Citadel DLC.</strong></p>
<p>Also we talk about Frank Miller for reasons that will only make sense in retrospect.</p>
<p><strong>50:32 Crimson peak</strong></p>

<p>Did you have trouble getting the Diecast to work with your RSS feed last week? I mistakenly had the download link pointed at “diecast117”, when it should have linked to “diecast117<strong>.mp3</strong>“. I noticed the problem a day later, and “fixed” it by changing the link to “diecast1<strong>7</strong>7.mp3″. I didn’t notice <em>that</em> blunder until Sunday when I write this post.</p>
<p>So, that was a pretty comprehensive failure on my part. Should be fixed now. Or maybe not. I’m probably not the most reliable person to ask, to be honest. But as far as I know, it should all work.</p>

Did you have trouble getting the Diecast to work with your RSS feed last week? I mistakenly had the download link pointed at “diecast117”, when it should have linked to “diecast117.mp3“. I noticed the problem a day later, and “fixed” it by changing the link to “diecast177.mp3″. I didn’t notice that blunder until Sunday when I write this post.

So, that was a pretty comprehensive failure on my part. Should be fixed now. Or maybe not. I’m probably not the most reliable person to ask, to be honest. But as far as I know, it should all work.

Show notes:

00:45: Oculus Rift Tech Demos

Here is the Don’t Let Go demo we talked about.

10:22: Invisible Inc.

22:28: Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture

37:00: Shadow of the Colossus

44:57: Good Robot

Here is the trailer I mentioned:

And here’s a screenshot from last week:

53:35 Pillars of Eternity
1:00:55: JOHN CENA
1:02:25: Mailbag: BioWare Characters

Hey Mumbles, can we get a top ten best bioware characters list from you now that you have played through Dragon Age Inquisition.
Thanks, Jokerman.

<p>Hey, everyone, it’s Rutskarn. I don’t know if you’ve been keeping up with your farmer’s almanac, but the Time of Terror and Blood&nbsp;was recently upon us,&nbsp;and the Great Beast you know as Josh was briefly trapped inside the Southern California ley line. I took advantage of his psychic imprisonment to schedule an ad hoc game of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoia_(role-playing_game)">Paranoia</a>.</em> Unfortunately for you, I recorded it.</p>
<p>Also starring: Josh’s brother Glitch, Glitch’s fiancee Madison.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this session was planned, run, recorded, and in some capacity edited on the fly. I didn’t even know&nbsp;we’d be playing <em>Paranoia</em> when I arrived (I brought a suitcase and flash drive that contained about fifteen separate&nbsp;systems and let them decide). Despite that, we had a lot of fun, and hopefully you will too. I’ve cleaned the audio as best as I could and trimmed a few breaks, but I’ll warn you up front–it’s far from perfect. The Hellish winds that follow Josh like ashen cherubs have that effect on a recording suite.</p>
<p>(Note also that anyone who illustrates anything that happened in this session will earn my undying love.)</p>
<p>And below the fold, all notes and secret information that passed this session:</p>
<p><span id="more-28177"></span><br>
<strong>Josh&nbsp;</strong>had the mutant power to phase through solid objects when he gave a signal. He was part of a secret society that wanted to gain as much information as possible about the plant. They planted a camera for him in a can of Bouncy Bubble Beverage.&nbsp;<strong>Glitch&nbsp;</strong>had the mutant power to turn invisible. He was part of a secret society that suspected someone was trying to sabotage the plant. He’d know who the saboteur was because they were acting suspicious, wandering into restricted areas, and recovering classified information.&nbsp;<strong>Madison&nbsp;</strong>had the mutant power to read notes passed. She was part of a secret society that wanted her to become as irradiated as possible without actually dying. How irradiated is that? Left to her discretion.</p>
<p>And now, the notes. Highlight to declassify:</p>
<p>NOTE 1: <span style="color: #ffffff;">MADISON, YOU ARE FIELD-PROMOTED TO LOYALTY OFFICER. KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR MUTANTS AND TRAITORS.</span></p>
<p>NOTE 2: <span style="color: #ffffff;">JOSH, YOU FOUND YOUR CAMERA</span></p>

Roses was the lead in Serena. She also has other projects in the works, and here we talk about the logistics of indie voice acting.

9:00: I Have no Mouth and I Must Scream

After this recording, I picked up this game on GoG. I’m less than an hour in, but I will say I’m sorry I overlooked this for so many years. If I had just glanced at the back of the box or read the synopsis I’d probably have picked it up. Ah well.

17:45 King’s Quest Reboot

Here is Roses’ review of the game. I’ll also talk about it in this week’s Experienced Points column.

34:44 Mattress

43:00 What pre-1995 games would you like to see get a remake / reboot / revival / rehash?

This question goes for everyone in the comments as well.

56:00 Windows 10 Minutes of Monologue

Discuss: Why is Microsoft pushing so hard to give this away? What’s their plan for the future?

<p><strong>37:00 Romance in videogames.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast:</p>
<p>As games keep trying to be more like movies, how do think their writers can, should, and actually will address the challenges of more often including romance as a sub-plot (or a primary plot, Catherine for example)?</p>
<p>The added challenge of romance specifically in video games is that every player has unique preferences, so you can’t just make a character “likeable” and call it day. Movies can create chemistry between two characters and the audience accepts that they like each other, but game protagonists are expected to be influenced by the player’s personality. If the protagonist hooks up with someone whom the player is not attracted to, it can feel like an uncomfortable forcing of the hand, even worse for the fact that it puts romance, sex, and “forcing” in the same context.</p>
<p>I look forwarded to hearing each host’s perspective, and perhaps what lessons we can learn from past examples.</p>

<strong>0:30 Arkham Knight PC release was so bad the the publisher pulled it from shelves.</strong></p>
<p>“Pulled it from shelves”? Pfft. As if they have shelf space for PC games at Gamestop. What is this, 1998?</p>
<p>Josh mentions the story about the <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/batman-arkham-knight-batmobile-edition-canceled-du/1100-6428307/">$200 Batmobile Edition of the game, which was canceled due to “quality control” issues</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a thought experiment: WB plans to sell these crappy Batmobile statues by making them part of the $200 collector’s edition. They plan a run of N thousand statues. There’s a certain overhead to selling mass-produced crap like this, so you need to sell in volume if you want to make money. Then let’s imagine that when the pre-orders roll in, instead of thousands of people ordering the Batmobile edition, they only got a few hundred. There’s no way they can sell just a few hundred of these without losing a ton of money. </p>
<p>If you’re an executive at WB, what do you do? If you’re an idiot you can tell the truth and admit your product is far less popular than you anticipated, and you can piss off fans by going back on the implied promise of a pre-order. You look bad, your product looks bad, and your customers are pissed. Alternatively, you can claim that there are “quality control issues”. This makes it sound like it’s not your fault at all. It’s not you, it’s that crappy factory in China! They made sub-standard products, and you have heroically decided to give up all those sweet pre-orders rather than sell your customers a sub-standard Batmobile.</p>
<p>I want to stress that this a made-up scenario on my part. But my point is that the “quality control” line is the best answer they could possibly give. This answer <em>might</em> be the truth, but it’s also suspiciously the most perfect and expedient deflection of blame they could have offered. I can’t prove – or even seriously <em>allege</em> – anything, but I do find myself looking a this very cynically.</p>

<p>It’s a mailbag this week! I think we answered around 33% of the questions. I’m starting to think we need to do this more often. Once again, I’ve wiped the slate clean so if your question didn’t make it, it’s time to re-word or re-send if you’re still looking for an answer.</p>
<p>Another week, another apology for wonky audio. I’m really frustrated now because I have the right tools but I keep making dumb newbie mistakes. This week I left a fan on. Not one of those “whisper quiet” fans. And this thing wasn’t sitting across the room from me. This was a roaring box fan, right at my feet. Why? <em>Why did I not turn off the fan</em>?</p>

It’s a mailbag this week! I think we answered around 33% of the questions. I’m starting to think we need to do this more often. Once again, I’ve wiped the slate clean so if your question didn’t make it, it’s time to re-word or re-send if you’re still looking for an answer.

Another week, another apology for wonky audio. I’m really frustrated now because I have the right tools but I keep making dumb newbie mistakes. This week I left a fan on. Not one of those “whisper quiet” fans. And this thing wasn’t sitting across the room from me. This was a roaring box fan, right at my feet. Why? Why did I not turn off the fan?

Audio editing got rid of the worst of it, but the ghost of the sound is still there when I talk. And I’m sure you’ll hear it now that I made a big deal about it. Don’t worry, I’m sure in another 109 episodes or so I’ll figure out how to run this show.

Hosts: Shamus, Campster,  Josh, and Mumbles.

Show notes:

1:00 MP3 vs. OGG

Is Shamus willing to dig into the server logs and tell us what the
percentages are between the Diecast’s various delivery methods? How do
MP3 compare to Ogg, etc…
Peter H. Coffin

3:00 Turn-based Systems and the Witcher on Spoiler Warning.

Dear Diecast
I heard you talking about turn-based systems and mechanics and it got me wondering if any of you played Jagged Alliance 2?
Also, (when) can we expect Witcher 3 Spoiler Warning season?
Best regards.
Josef

8:00 Design-a-Vault!

Dear Diecast,
If you could design a vault in the new Fallout 4 game, what would it look like? What kind of bizarro scientific experiment would be fun to uncover?
Also, since I sent this for Mumbles, who would win a wrestling match between crows and squirrels?
Thanks for your wonderful podcast,
The Fighting Doll

23:00 Next Gen.

Dear Diecast
My Question is about “Next Gen”.
So we all know what next generation graphics are going to look like, peers out of the window and sighs.
What does everyone think next generation mechanics should look/play like?
Examples:
If we have “twice the power” of the previous gen, can we render 2 of the previous gen games at once to do strange overlapping levels?
Less polygons more fluid animations?
Being able to create more complex AI or Simulations?
Or just the ability to never have to see a loading screen ever again.
From
Michelle in England

34:00 The Hinterlands

Dear Diecast
What makes you able to play and enjoy the Witcher 3 or Skyrim, but makes you get stuck in the Hinterlands in Inquisition for hours?
– Christopher

45:00 Books that expand on the lore of a game.

Deer Diecast.
Catching up on the Witcher games and watching the hangout, I noticed how the games make inevitable callbacks to the books.
My question is, what do you think about books that expand on the lore of a videogame? (lumping together videogames based on books and vice versa as well as books accompanying games).
Also if Josh could tell us real quick if the books are worthwile for fans of the witcher games.
Yours,
Ben

This is the SuperBunnyHop that Chris mentioned:

And here is the Vine that Mumbles made for Chris.

55:00 Ruby Tuesday.

Dear Casters of all things Pod,
Why do video games always come out on Tuesdays? How did that start?
Best regards,
Jared

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Happy 2015! Enjoy this extra-long Diecast with a full crew and a lot of topics. </p>
<p>Hosts: <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/">Shamus</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarecrow_%28DC_Comics%29">Josh</a>, <a href="http://www.chocolatehammer.org/">Rutskarn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nicemovemumbles">Mumbles</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Campster">Chris</a>. </p>
<p>Show notes:<span id="more-25572"></span><br />
<strong>2:00 Mumbles is reading Batman: Endgame.</strong></p>
<p>CORRECTION: During the conversation I mention a “Think Geek” Loot Crate, but I’m pretty sure <a href="https://www.lootcrate.com/">Loot Crate</a> isn’t affiliated with Think Geek. The deal is that for a small monthly fee (around $12-ish) you get a box of random geek crap supposedly worth $40. I’m sure it’s just overstock stuff some other outfit is trying to unload quickly. It’s the online equivalent of a bargain bin. But it’s also strangely fun. We got it for my son on his birthday, and getting our monthly loot crate is a big deal around here. Everyone gathers around to see what bits of random fandom we got this month. </p>
<p><strong>20:00 Mumbles recommends Lost Constellation.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://finji.itch.io/lost-constellation">You can get it from the official site</a> and is offered on a “name your own price” basis.</p>
<p><strong>22:00 Chris is playing “You Don’t Know Jack”.</strong></p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZcX_ZdlW3Q">the new Errant Signal is out! It’s about GTA V</a>. </p>
<p><strong>28:00 Josh is playing roguelikes.</strong> </p>
<p><a href="http://te4.org/wiki/Tales_of_Maj%27Eyal_Wiki">Tome</a>  </p>
<p><strong>34:00 Shamus isn’t playing much of the videogames.</strong></p>
<p>Instead I’m writing my end-of-year stuff and watching speed runs. Here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SpeedDemosArchiveSDA">Awesome Games Done Quick</a>. But really, I’m a sucker for any Deus Ex or Human Revolution speedruns. I don’t know why, but I love watching this bonkers secret agent save the world through inexplicable nonsense and hilarious stunt-jumping. </p>
<p><strong>37:00 Josh is fighting with Windows.</strong></p>
<p><strong>43:00 Ruts is also playing roguelikes!</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/">Stone Soup Dungeon Crawl</a>.</p>
<p><strong>48:00 Rutskarn is making a new campaign setting.</strong></p>
<p>Also he’s working on his FMV game idea in the margins. Also we talk about rollerblades for a long time. I can’t even explain why. It just happened.</p>
<p><strong>1:13:00 Shamus can do it.</strong></p>
<p>True story: At the one hour 13 minute mark Chris jokes that I could help Rutskarn make this FMV game. I didn’t join in on the joke, because a few minutes earlier Rutkarn had said that he would need to find someone to make the game, or that he would need to program it himself. </p>
<p>That immediately got me thinking, because writing a video player would be monumentally hard for a new coder, but the simple logic that drives a small-scale FMV game would be a fantastic thing for a new coder to work on.  So it seems like you’d need some kind of simplified video player (it would only need to handle one format) that used game logic as a front end. This got me to thinking about the most recent chapter of <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/">Game Programming Patterns</a>, which talked about building a virtual machine to process your own scripting language, so you can handle exactly these kinds of specialized problems where you need artists to be able to code simple things. (The example given in the book is a system where artists could add complex spell effects to the game without needing to get the coders involved. You just need to be able to examine and change stats and create particles.) So I started thinking about scripting languages and what you’d need to be able to do with one in order to drive an FMV game.</p>
<p>Suddenly my name came up in conversation and I had no idea what anyone was talking about. It wasn’t until I edited this episode that I realized I missed the joke about working on the project because I was daydreaming about how one would go about working on the project.</p>
<p><strong>1:16:00 Adventures With Content ID.</strong></p>
<p>Josh tells the story of when we tried to upload the New Year episode of Far Cry 4 and YouTube killed it because the credits used a copyrighted song. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week we have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pushinguproses">a guest</a> on the show. And since it’s December 22nd, I guess this qualifies our Christmas episode. Sort of. Not that we talk about Christmas. But, you know…. Merry Christmas. Or whatever. </p>

<p>Show notes:<span id="more-25420"></span></p>
<p><strong>2:00 Pushing Up Roses talks about her collection of antique computers.</strong></p>
<p>We talk about the IBM 5150, the Tandy 1000, old keyboards, and THIS monstrosity:</p>
<p>If this is their “Deluxe Joystick”, then I’d hate to see what their shitty joysticks look like. Everything about this design is wrong. Let’s zoom in:</p>
<p>The stick is short and slender, making it both fragile and uncomfortable to hold. And then it’s crowned with a real, actual <strong>serrated edge</strong>. That’s a real thing that somebody did on purpose. And this design was in use for years. </p>
<p>The button is a nasty stiff cube with a smooth surface and sharp corners, so you can either rest your thumb on the surface and have it slip off, or push on the edge and let it poke you. The little levers beside the joystick are for adjusting the calibration. They’re right there in the open where you can brush against them and throw the joystick out of whack, so be sure to avoid touching those! (You’ll know if you do. They have serrated edges too.)</p>
<p>This joystick hates you.</p>
<p><strong>26:00 King’s Quest is a thing again.</strong></p>
<p>Here is the trailer I was talking about:</p>
<p><strong>35:00 “Retro” games.</strong></p>
<p>At some point the conversation drifts to FMV games. So… watch out for that.</p>

35:00 “Retro” games.

At some point the conversation drifts to FMV games. So… watch out for that.

<p>Thinking about the Alan Wake season. It’s interesting how in that season you talked about improving it’s game play and storytelling themes by removing 70%-90% of the enemies.

Do you think there is a quantifiable amount of combat/enemies that should be in a game?

The journalist who criticized it wound up being fired, and the guy who participated (Geoff Keighley) went on to greater things and eventually hosted this awards show.

<p>I have no idea what happened to this conversation. We became so sarcastic we wrapped all the way around and started arguing our sarcastic points in earnest. Or something?</p>
<p>I can only speak for myself, but I think my position is: GTA V is no worse in content than dozens of other things you can buy at Target and its removal is nothing more than shrill voices getting their way. On the other hand, I’m having trouble marshaling my outrage because the game is so obnoxious and sanctimonious towards the American culture that makes its success possible. The game is greeted with both fawning adulation and outraged calls for censorship, and I don’t think it deserves either. </p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: Haven’t played V yet because they’re dragging their feet on a PC release. This opinion is based on my impressions of IV, and of the bits of the game I’ve seen so far. I’ll find out first-hand when they finally get around to the PC release next month.</em></p>

Dear Diecast.

I was rewatching your Mass Effect-Spoiler Warning seasons recently, and one thing Shamus brought up during Mass Effect 1 was wanting to court-martial Ashley for killing Wrex, and throw her out of the party. My question is, do you think writers should try to make more of an effort to account for the fact that players might not like a companion character, and let players do things like throw a companion out of the party – especially when they do controversial things like in this example – instead of seemingly writing characters under the assumption that players will love them?

And so we go right back to talking about the Dragon Age games.

43:00 Surprise email, introduced mid-topic!

Dear Diecast, Hi everyone! Did you know Ruts streamed the second half of the last Diecast (recorded 23/11/2014), and I got to listen to it live? For an actual question, How do you feel about twists in game design, and especially games that outright reveal the twist, but keep it hidden only through the protagonist denying it? All the best, keep diecasting, Merzendi.

From here we go on to talk about the dangers of accidental livestreaming. This is a problem just waiting to make headlines.

46:30 And now back to the planned list of mailbag questions…

Die Dearcast,Is there a foreseeable way put of the “everything is a franchise” mindset in the more expensive echelons of game development? If so, or if not, where do you think it might come from?Yours, Ira.P.S.: Mr. Viel, what is a good entry point into the Shin Megami Tensei series? I’ve loved it from afar for a few years, but don’t know how or where to get involved.

Dear Diecast,How do you podcast with boxing gloves on?More seriously, several youtube commentators (TotalBiscut, Super Bunnyhop, etc.) have mentioned having a better experience when gaming at 60 or even 120 fps vs. a fixed 30 fps. Are you able to notice any kinesthetic difference between these standards? Does it even matter for the types of games that you play?-Anthony

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I have two pieces of exciting news for you! The first is that Mumbles is on this week! The second is that Rutskarn isn’t!</p>
<p>Hosts: <a href="http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/">Chris</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpatine">Josh</a>, <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale">Shamus</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/nicemovemumbles">Galaxy Gun</a>.</p>
<p>Show notes: <span id="more-24956"></span></p>
<p><strong>00:30 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT0GSPxf0vw">Jim Sterling poked fun at Slaughtering Grounds</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Spoiler: <em>The developer responded poorly.</em></p>
<p><strong>10:00 Mumbles discusses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOPA2upeCA">Gotham</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>19:00 Mumbles discusses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0BMx-qxsP4">John Wick</a>.</strong></p>
<p>The truth is that I go to see combat-oriented movies for the same reason other people go to the ballet: I love to see talented and athletic artists and inventive choreography. (If you’re curious, my favorite right now is IP Man with Donnie Yen. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve watched that movie. My favorite bit is the first fight. Nothing deadly. They aren’t trying to kill or even hurt each other. It’s just a really fun exchange that weaves character development into the fight itself.)</p>
<p><strong>31:00 Josh is playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndWstc2wHl4">The Fall</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Just so you know, when people talk about “The Swapper”, it’s impossible for me to not hear “This Whopper”. Which I imagine would be a very different kind of game.</p>
<p><strong>36:00 Ubisoft games vanished from Steam. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/11/ubisoft-pulls-upcoming-holiday-titles-off-steam/">Then returned</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Ubisoft sucks. Uplay sucks.</p>
<p><strong>41:00 Star Wars Episode VII: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/06/showbiz/movies/star-wars-7-the-force-awakens/index.html">The Force Awakens</a></strong></p>

      <itunes:summary>I have two pieces of exciting news for you! The first is that Mumbles is on this week! The second is that Rutskarn isn’t!

Hosts: Chris, Josh, Shamus, and Galaxy Gun.

Show notes:

00:30 Jim Sterling poked fun at Slaughtering Grounds.

Spoiler: The developer responded poorly.

10:00 Mumbles discusses Gotham.

19:00 Mumbles discusses John Wick.

The truth is that I go to see combat-oriented movies for the same reason other people go to the ballet: I love to see talented and athletic artists and inventive choreography. (If you’re curious, my favorite right now is IP Man with Donnie Yen. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve watched that movie. My favorite bit is the first fight. Nothing deadly. They aren’t trying to kill or even hurt each other. It’s just a really fun exchange that weaves character development into the fight itself.)

31:00 Josh is playing The Fall.

Just so you know, when people talk about “The Swapper”, it’s impossible for me to not hear “This Whopper”. Which I imagine would be a very different kind of game.

36:00 Ubisoft games vanished from Steam. Then returned.

Ubisoft sucks. Uplay sucks.

41:00 Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens

I think we forget all about Star Wars in this segment for a bit and go on a tangent where we discover that everyone on the show is an oldest child.

49:00 GTA V for PC and new-gen consoles will have a first-person mode.

53:00 Destiny 2 is in development.

Here is a spoiler-free synopsis of the plot that is truly amazing…

1:02:00 Blizzard announces Overwatch.

For all you Gragon Age 3 players, here is Mumbles Twitter, which she mentioned in the show.

      <itunes:summary>Hosts: Josh, Shamus, Rutskarn, Chris, and Arvind.

Show notes: 2:30 Blizzard canceled it’s upcoming MMO, Tighten Titan.

We also talk about Destiny here.

17:00

Dear Diecast,Back in Diecast #2, drawn by Zach Snyder and written by Frank Quitely, the Diecasters made several humorous japes about possible future games based on the abused Aliens franchise.One of them, Rutskarn’s “Hiding-based stealth game”, has(sorta) come true in the form of Alien: Isolation.Judging by what I’ve seen and read, it doesn’t look like it’ll make up monetarily for Colonial Marines, or encourage future efforts like it. What are the odds that Sega will go back to small-hearted manshoots?

28:00

Dear Diecast team,you probably know that Steam recently introduced Steam Curators, alongside the general store front overhaul. What do you think about it, and could you imagine acting as such a Curator yourselves? Maybe under the “Spoiler Warning” label, or as a “Twentysided Curator” or similar?Best regards, Niko

49:00

Dear Diecast, Thanks for all the work you guys do. Spoiler Warning and the Diecast make late nights in the lab much more enjoyable. A few questions for you: -How do you pick which Kevin Macleod song you will use for the ending credits of spoiler warning? -Are there any games from the spoiler warning seasons that you regret picking? How about the specials? (Trainz!)regards, -Anthony

55:00

Ruts’s friend BlackFox here–I’ve been going through old Diecasts and noticed that you’ve been linking Josh’s name to such things as: the wiki page for Teddy Roosevelt the wiki page for Grigori Rasputin the wiki page for Machiavelli the wiki page for Troll (bridge variety) the wiki page for Troll (internet variety) the wiki page for Macedonian, which you all had an argument over how to pronounce in that Diecast various other wiki pages intended to be indicative of Josh’s grouchiness the Guild Wars 2 wiki page for the weapon called Incinerator a recent Spoiler Warning whiskey This is all highly amusing. So the actual question: Has anyone else actually noticed this? Rutskarn and Jarenth had not.

We didn’t actually answer this on the show, so for the record: For the first few dozen episodes, when I linked to Josh’s name in the hosts list I’d link to a different random thing every time. I stopped doing it because nobody noticed. But now I guess someone noticed.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The plan this week was to talk about the canceled Blizzard MMO and a few other current topics. Instead we talked about a sixteen-year-old hack-n-slash. I don’t know. That’s how this show goes sometimes.</p>
<p>And yes, I’m still fiddling with the theme music. Based on the feedback last week, most people would prefer if I just went back to the original theme that we used for 70 episodes. I might. But allow me this little vanity for now. It’s short and I’m having fun with it.</p>

<p><strong>2:00 Shamus is playing Diablo 2.</strong></p>

<p><strong>19:00 Josh is playing Final Fantasy 13.</strong></p>
<p>Warning: I’m pretty sure Josh spoils the plot of the game in this segment. I can’t tell for sure because I had slammed my hands over my ears, groaning uncontrollably after the first hour of his description.</p>
<p><strong>35:00 Jarenth is playing <a href="http://www.puuba.com/">Concursion</a> and Crypt of the NecroDancer.</strong></p>

<p><strong>45:00 Rutskarn is playing Payday 2 and Far Cry 2.</strong></p>
<p>But instead of talking about those he tells us some tabletop gaming stories, which are a lot more interesting.</p>

      <itunes:summary>The plan this week was to talk about the canceled Blizzard MMO and a few other current topics. Instead we talked about a sixteen-year-old hack-n-slash. I don’t know. That’s how this show goes sometimes.

And yes, I’m still fiddling with the theme music. Based on the feedback last week, most people would prefer if I just went back to the original theme that we used for 70 episodes. I might. But allow me this little vanity for now. It’s short and I’m having fun with it.

Hosts: Jarenth, Josh, Shamus, and Rutskarn.

Show notes:

2:00 Shamus is playing Diablo 2.

Here is the video I mentioned: Ideas about a new programming language for games.

19:00 Josh is playing Final Fantasy 13.

Warning: I’m pretty sure Josh spoils the plot of the game in this segment. I can’t tell for sure because I had slammed my hands over my ears, groaning uncontrollably after the first hour of his description.

35:00 Jarenth is playing Concursion and Crypt of the NecroDancer.

Here is his review on Concursion.

But somehow we end up talking about leaderboad games. This is the game I was talking about. I like it a bunch. Just remember: Don’t tell Chris.

45:00 Rutskarn is playing Payday 2 and Far Cry 2.

But instead of talking about those he tells us some tabletop gaming stories, which are a lot more interesting.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Experiment: This week I shifted the participants a little to the left or right speakers. My hope is that this can help untangle cross-talk when it happens. Usually one person just overpowers another, and if you want to hear the person who got drowned out, you’re out of luck.</p>
<p>I actually edit the audio to fix as much cross-talk as I can.  If (during recording) I charge in saying, “You know what? I think that-” and then I shut up because I realize I’m overlapping with someone else, then during editing I’ll just mute that phrase so the other person can be heard more clearly. Basically, when two people talk at once, I’ll mute the one who retreated. But there are still instances of overlapping that just can’t be helped.  Maybe this stereo separation will help, or maybe it will just be annoying and distracting.</p>

16:00

Shamus,Good Robot.  What’s the happy haps?Best Regards, Jared

20:00

What is your opinion, the hopefully not skeleton crew this week, of the Depth of Field, Bloom, and Motion Blur? Do you turn it off, love it, hate it, something else? Hopefully you have different opinions of those special effects amongst each other. -Thearpox

For an example of the “everything is plastic” look we were taking about, see my Dead Island: Stream-of-Gameplay Review.

32:00

Humanoid has announced on the forum that he is going to play crusader kings 2 from scratch (meaning he is just now learning how to play the game) till the end before you finish your turn.Will you just lay down and let him step over you like that,you pushover you?Also something something shogun 2 something.Sincerely,Daemian Lucifer.

32:30

Hello allAre you planing to do TWDs2 on Spoiler Warning while it’s still fresh or did you have your fill of the franchise with the first one? Without going into spoilers do you fall into majority or minority on the big choice at the end?Are you going to do Wolf anytime soon/ever?-shiroax

39:00

Is there a reason you aren’t on iTunes? I ask now because another videogame podcast I thought nobody listened to got to #5 or 6 on iTunes gaming podcasts. Also because I hate changing metadata from ‘music’ to ‘podcast’.Much admiration,Thomas Johnson

41:00

Dear Casters of the Die,You hear a lot of comments about games, movies, etc. with ancient traps working perfectly with no regard to maintanence and decay, but I’ve only ever run into one story that actually satirized that trope. Have you come across any stories that make fun of it? Do you think there’s a reason such a common trope seems to have so few parodies/satires?Thanks for allowing the brainpicking, Jakale

Upon reflection, the old DM of the Rings strip isn’t really relevant to what Jakale is talking about. But Rutskarn’s project deals with it more directly.

44:00

Dear Diecast,

How much do your online personas differ from your real life personalities?  For example, is Mumbles really a cannibal that enjoys watching the suffering of others?Best Regards, Jared

55:00

Do you think its better to balance costs of items and upgrades based on what they’d be worth in the world or based on what they’re worth to the player?Like the parachute jump upgrade in Deus Ex Human Revolution. It seems like it would be the most expensive augmentation in real life but in terms of its game effect, as you pointed out on Spoiler Warning, its generally just a convenience and other upgrades are much more useful for game related tasks.

Show notes:

1:00 The New Nintendo 3Ds

Yes, Nintendo is coming out with a new product that is just called “New [Old Product Name]“, which is fine when you’re making cereal or laundry detergent, but bad when you’re talking about devices with distinct generations and compatibility issues.

18:00 Shamus is playing Sunless Sea.

Sunless Sea is by the people who brought us Echo Bazaar / Fallen London.

23:00 Mumbles is playing Wind Waker.

25:00 Mumbles is also playing TF2 beta maps.

28:30 Mumbles has watched the Gotham Extended trailer.

39:00 Chris is playing Five Nights at Freddy’s.

We went a little off-topic before going WAY off topic, before coming back around and losing our way completely. Here is the Loading Ready Run skit that I mentioned. (My favorite.)

Dear The Diecast,Josh, (Mr. Viel?) What is your background in the study of history? Is your interest personal or has it been at some point professional? Only asking because you seem to have a decent grasp of a fairly broad swath of world history, and I’m interested to know where this is coming from.

1:00 The Next Tomb Raider game will be an Xbox One exclusive.

I’ll have a column about this tomorrow.

19:00 The sad state of the superhero MMO genre.

We’re talking about City of Heroes, Champions Online, DC Universe Online, and Marvel Heroes. Here is what I had to say about DC Universe Online way back in 2011. And here is what I had to say about Champions Online.

Here is the City of Titans Kickstarter that we discussed, and here is their website, which we were sort of mocking.

<p>Show notes:</p>
<p><span id="more-23949"></span><strong>1:00 <a href="http://blog.bioware.com/2014/08/07/casey-hudsons-departure-from-biowareea/">Casey Hudson departs BioWare</a>.</strong></p>
<p>In retrospect, a bit of this comes off as gossipy. Sorry about that. Be sure to read <a href="http://blog.bioware.com/2014/08/07/casey-hudsons-departure-from-biowareea/">the announcement</a> and remember anything that’s not said in that announcement is conjecture on our part.</p>
<p>This discussion leads to the first mailbag of the week:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p><p>With the recent re-opening of the Mass Effect Wounds at Twenty Sided and three recent tweets by Shamus, it seems appropriate to ask this question:</p><p>Why is it that after all this time and an Extended Cut DLC that ‘explained everything’, the very mention of Mass Effect 3, a game that was released in March 2012, STILL has the ability to drive people nuts?  Plenty of other games suffer from bad writing in one form or another – why is it that this one rubs people so raw to this day?  Is there another game you can think of that even comes close?</p><p>Cheers,<br /> RTBones</p></blockquote>
<p>I answered this in part on the show, but I’m going to answer it more fully in tomorrow’s column.</p>
<p><strong>25:00 <a href="http://blog.twitch.tv/2014/08/3136/">Twitch TV has rolled out a dumb broken ContentID system.</a></strong></p>
<p>Like I said the other day:</p>

Show notes:

1:00 Casey Hudson departs BioWare.

In retrospect, a bit of this comes off as gossipy. Sorry about that. Be sure to read the announcement and remember anything that’s not said in that announcement is conjecture on our part.

This discussion leads to the first mailbag of the week:

Dear Diecast,With the recent re-opening of the Mass Effect Wounds at Twenty Sided and three recent tweets by Shamus, it seems appropriate to ask this question:Why is it that after all this time and an Extended Cut DLC that ‘explained everything’, the very mention of Mass Effect 3, a game that was released in March 2012, STILL has the ability to drive people nuts?  Plenty of other games suffer from bad writing in one form or another – why is it that this one rubs people so raw to this day?  Is there another game you can think of that even comes close?Cheers, RTBones

I answered this in part on the show, but I’m going to answer it more fully in tomorrow’s column.

25:00 Twitch TV has rolled out a dumb broken ContentID system.

Like I said the other day:

38:30 Sims 4 is missing a lot of features.

It didn’t sound like a big deal to me at first, but it all sounds kind of shocking when you actually read the list. It’s even more worrisome when you remember what happened to SimCity. Is EA going to ruin two major Maxis titles with their meddling? I’m perversely anxious to find out.

51:00 MAILTIME!

Dear Diecast,Spoiler Warning has Reginald Cuftbert as a recurring character in every new game. Do any members of the cast have their own special character that makes a return in the various games that you play?Kana

<p><strong>1:30 News: <a href="http://variety.com/2014/digital/news/youtube-to-acquire-videogame-streaming-service-twitch-for-1-billion-sources-1201185204/">YouTube buys Twitch</a> for $LOLOL dollars.</strong></p>
<p><strong>11:00 Crytek’s <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2014/7/27/5941815/crytek-rumor-homefront-statement">ongoing financial problems</a>.</strong></p>
<p>We glossed over a point that I wanted to talk about in more detail: As Jarenth said, Crytek is known for making “really pretty” games. Or game engines. But we’re so far past the point of diminishing returns that their skills are basically moot. Think of it this way: Imagine the programmers at Crytek could suddenly make all their graphics run 50% faster. You can just hand-wave it and say a wizard makes it so that when running Cry Engine games, graphics cards have 50% more power.</p>
<p>I maintain that this benefit – even though it’s a complete miracle – would be of very limited business value. Homefront flopped, and that had nothing to do with its graphics. (In fact, I’m pretty sure the graphics were the only thing they got right. Which makes it even more mysterious as to why CryTek would bother with it.) When was the last time a game really sold on the basis of its graphics alone? AAA graphics are like pizza and sex: Even when they’re way below average, they’re still pretty great.</p>
<p><strong>27:00 The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/winterkewlgames/yogventures/posts">Yogventures Kickstarter</a> did not <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/07/17/yogscast-cancel-kickstarter-backed-yogventures-say-its-failure-is-a-deep-regret/">end well</a>.</strong></p>
<p>And here is the related mailbag question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast</p><p>I’m wondering how you feel about well funded corporations resorting to crowd funding, in specific I was wondering about your views of Steam’s recent Crowd funding of their DOTA 2 international prize pool given that only 25% of the money donated went into the actual prize pool?</p><p>Regards<br /> Random Internet Lurker</p></blockquote>
<p>The Yogventures story is so sad. Half a million bucks, and very little to show for it other than a lot of rumors and finger-pointing. Contrast this with how the <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=23830" title="Unrest: An Honest Postmortem of a Kickstarter Success">Unrest kickstarter turned out</a>. This is not to rub salt in the Yogventures wound, but only to point out how important it is that these projects are transparent so that we can all learn from each other’s mistakes.</p>

<p><span id="more-23748"></span><br /> <strong>00:30 Intro, wherein Campster makes a joke about fedoras.</strong></p>
<p>For the record: I joined in on the joke, but I actually think the fedora is a fine hat when worn in the right context. It’s gotten a bad reputation online from some people attempting to build their persona / establish a character around a simple hat, and it’s been rightfully maligned because some people insist on wearing them with otherwise casual clothing. A fedora is a “dress up” hat, not a “dress down” hat, and wearing it casually is like pairing a bowtie with an <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ed+Hardy+shirt&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS518US518&amp;es_sm=122&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZE7MU6OHB9agyAS214GwDw&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1192&amp;bih=760&amp;dpr=1.5">Ed Hardy shirt</a>. (PROTIP: <strong>DO NOT.</strong>)</p>
<p>But if you don a fedora with proper slacks, a dress shirt, and a vest? Ignore the haters. That shit is <em>dapper</em>.</p>
<p><strong>01:00 Let’s talk about <a href="http://pyrodactyl.com/">Unrest</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>19:00 We talk about food for no reason.</strong></p>
<p>I feel like a failure as a host. When Josh started talking about how the appendix was a vestigial organ, I was kind of torn. Do I let him know that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermiform_appendix#Maintaining_gut_flora">appendix has actually been found to have a purpose</a>, thus dragging us even further off-topic? Or do I let him go, thus increasing the number and intensity of the corrections in the comments? Maybe I made the wrong call. I guess we’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>21:00 Back to Unrest.</strong></p>
<p>Get it from <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/292400">Steam</a>, Humble Bundle, or from the <a href="http://pyrodactyl.com/">developer’s website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>23:00 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1wUirNlR0U">MAIL TIME</a>!</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi,<br /> I have heard Shamus say several times that YouTube ContentID can identify cutscenes but cannot identify gameplay.<br /> I understand that you do not have inside knowledge of Content ID, but do you as a gamer/programmer see any issue with IDing a game by its UI/HUD? It is distinctive for every game (or franchise) and it is always in the same place on screen.<br /> Thanks</p><p>Josef</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>So sales of the Xbox One appear to have doubled since June 9th, which is when Microsoft stopped making the Kinect mandatory as part of the package.  My question is this: how much do you think the increase in sales is simply because of the price cut and how much do you think it’s because people flat out didn’t want the Kinect and didn’t buy it because of that?</p><p>Best Regards,<br /> Jared</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p><p>I’m curious why Assassin’s Creed 2 is the only Assassin’s Creed game that has been done on Spoiler Warning.

      <itunes:summary>Hosts: Josh, Chris, Shamus, and Rutskarn, and Mumbles.

Show notes:

00:30 Intro, wherein Campster makes a joke about fedoras.

For the record: I joined in on the joke, but I actually think the fedora is a fine hat when worn in the right context. It’s gotten a bad reputation online from some people attempting to build their persona / establish a character around a simple hat, and it’s been rightfully maligned because some people insist on wearing them with otherwise casual clothing. A fedora is a “dress up” hat, not a “dress down” hat, and wearing it casually is like pairing a bowtie with an Ed Hardy shirt. (PROTIP: DO NOT.)

But if you don a fedora with proper slacks, a dress shirt, and a vest? Ignore the haters. That shit is dapper.

01:00 Let’s talk about Unrest.

19:00 We talk about food for no reason.

I feel like a failure as a host. When Josh started talking about how the appendix was a vestigial organ, I was kind of torn. Do I let him know that the appendix has actually been found to have a purpose, thus dragging us even further off-topic? Or do I let him go, thus increasing the number and intensity of the corrections in the comments? Maybe I made the wrong call. I guess we’ll see.

21:00 Back to Unrest.

Get it from Steam, Humble Bundle, or from the developer’s website.

23:00 MAIL TIME!

Hi, I have heard Shamus say several times that YouTube ContentID can identify cutscenes but cannot identify gameplay. I understand that you do not have inside knowledge of Content ID, but do you as a gamer/programmer see any issue with IDing a game by its UI/HUD? It is distinctive for every game (or franchise) and it is always in the same place on screen. ThanksJosef

So sales of the Xbox One appear to have doubled since June 9th, which is when Microsoft stopped making the Kinect mandatory as part of the package.  My question is this: how much do you think the increase in sales is simply because of the price cut and how much do you think it’s because people flat out didn’t want the Kinect and didn’t buy it because of that?Best Regards, Jared

Dear Diecast,I’m curious why Assassin’s Creed 2 is the only Assassin’s Creed game that has been done on Spoiler Warning.  As dumb as the series has gotten it’s usually at least been an interesting kind of stupid so it seems like it would be good for the show.Best Regards, Jared

Dear Diarycast, I am a huge fan of the show. I love you, Shamwow, Mumblo, Bogo, Peepants, and Buttskarn.I have been wondering for a while, what do you guys think of linearity in games? Aren’t game supposed to be interactive? Why are linear games (Half Life for instance) praised so highly when they offer very little player input beyond shooting?Basically this: how do you feel about “corridor shooters”?Thanks.~Forrest.

Rustkarn,As one of the people incredibly interested in both writing for video games and Unrest, I’ve always wanted to see a sort of detailed description of the process of writing for a narrative-heavy game. Would you be interested in doing a sort of ‘The Writing of Unrest’ series once the game is out?Keep on writing, Gilfareth

Whatever it is you young people do with data when you’re doing internet show-and-tell.

Hosts: Josh, Shamus, Mumbles, and Campster.

Show notes:

1:00 Shamus is playing Retro/Grade and Girls Like Robots.

Here are my original thought on Girls Like Robots after PAX 2012.

3:30 Shamus watched THE LEGO MOVIE.

Warning: Lengthy Batman conversation ensues. Here’s the Batman song we discussed. We also talk about Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man.

18:00 Mumbles is playing Divinity: Original Sin.

28:00 Chris has been playing Payday 2.

33:00 Chris has also been playing Valiant Hearts.

The rest of us haven’t played it. Here is what SuperBunnyHop has to say about it.

37:00 Chris has also been playing Dead Rising 3.

Wait, Dead Island 2 is being made by Yeager, the team behind Spec Ops: The Line? I have no idea how I feel about that. It’s either brilliant or idiotic.

46:00 Chis also got the Super Ultra Dead Rising 3′ Arcade Remix Hyper Edition EX + α.

That title is the kind of thing I make up to make fun of games with overly elaborate titles. Capcom knows all my moves, so they countered me by making a double ridiculous title. What am I supposed to do now? Make a triple ridiculous name? Or maybe reverse it and call the game “Dave”? Nah. I know when I’m beat.

You win this time, Capcom.

50:00 The challenges of having a large Steam library, buying games for making content, using footage from other people, fair use, YouTube culture, and Net Neutrality.

This is a little bit insider-y, but it’s the kind of stuff we worry about when shopping for games and making content.

Warning: Shamus becomes sad.

1:00:00 Mail time!

Dear Diecast,What genres of music do guys enjoy and how well do you think they’ve been implemented in games?-Protazoa34

<p><span id="more-23506"></span><strong>01:00 Rutskarn has been playing…</strong></p>
<p>Oops, we cut him off for a discussion about <a href="https://www.origin.com/en-us/store/">Origin</a> vs. Steam vs. <a href="http://www.gog.com/">GoG</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll admit I’ve been totally unfair to Origin. They’re making modest, incremental progress into the market and as someone who has been publicly hounding them to change, I really ought to <strong>at least</strong> have the decency to check out their free games.</p>
<p><strong>05:00 Rutskarn has been playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor:_Allied_Assault">Medal of Honor: Allied Assault</a> and </strong> <a href="http://www.gog.com/game/syndicate">Syndicate</a>.</p>
<p>“Nameless Bob” is now my favorite character name.</p>
<p><strong>20:30 Shamus talks about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Typing_of_the_Dead">Typing of the Dead</a>.</strong></p>
<p>What you’ve heard here is true: I do not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing">touch-type</a>. That’s pretty ridiculous for someone who types for a living. It’s like a professional driver not knowing how to operate a manual transmission. At any rate, if you’re looking to learn to touch-type, Typing of the Dead is not a good place to start.</p>
<p>Note the 22 minute mark when I try to explain how long it’s been since I was 15 years old. Nothing will destroy your capacity to perform simple math like making calculations based on your own age. When the left half of your brain offers up the right answer, the right half of your brain will jump in with, “Ridiculous! It can’t possibly have been that long. It’s probably… half that. Yeah. Half-ish.”</p>
<p><strong>33:00 Shamus talks about <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seanyoung/magicite-a-multiplayer-rpg-platformer">Magicite</a>.</strong></p>
<p>As I’m doing this write-up, I’ve discovered that <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seanyoung/magicite-a-multiplayer-rpg-platformer">Magicite is a Kickstarted game</a>. I should also add that if you’ve got a background with 2D platformers (like if you grew up with the NES, as I’m sure is true of most of the target audience of this game) your experience will likely be very different than mine. If you’re competent with that type of gameplay then I do recommend giving this a look. It’s got tons of charm.</p>
<p><strong>39:00 Shamus is also playing Retro / Grade.</strong></p>
<p>This game is my drug. Much love.  Here’s a trailer:</p>
<p><strong>44:00 Josh is playing <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2014/06/a-dark-room-the-best-selling-game-that-no-one-can-explain.html">A Dark Room</a>.</strong></p>

<p>We say we don’t have anything left to say about E3, but then we talk about it for ten minutes.

<p><strong>19:00 Let’s talk about something else.</strong></p>
<p>Like the terrible Watch_Dogs gameplay.</p>
<p><strong>38:00 Somewhere along the line we lose the plot and talk about Ubisoft and Elder Scrolls.</strong></p>
<p>We didn’t even plan to discuss Elder Scrolls this week. It just happened.</p>
<p><strong>50:00 Steam Summer Sale!</strong></p>
<p>Actually, while we were going to talk about the sale for this segment, we just wound up talking about what we’re playing. Go figure.</p>

1:00 Talk about the headline press conferences: Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, Ubisoft.

20:00 E3 is now streamed, so everyone can “attend”. How does this change the show?

29:00 EA had very little to show, and what they did show was odd.

36:00 Mumbles talks indies.

48:00 SHAMUS IS TIRED OF BORING VIDEOGAME TALK. GET TO TALKING ABOUT VR ALREADY.

Wolfenstein: The New Order shows you the horror of concentration camps from the first-person.

16:00 Shamus had a fight with Google.

28:00 A digression on various obnoxious / annoying / “evil” internet companies, from Google to Amazon.

This is what made me dislike Amazon, and question if our patent system does objectively more damage than good in the world.

49:00 Shamus and Mumble hijack things and talk comics for a bit.

We talk about Punisher, Dr. Strange, and The Superior Foes of Spider-Man. Tragically, TSFoSM isn’t yet available on Marvel Unlimited. At least, I think it isn’t. Their search functionality and catalog indexing is atrocious.

EDIT: I found it. Their own search engine was useless. Google took me right to it.

Show notes:

1:30 Bombshell

Behold the Bombshell site, in all its kitschy glory. Maybe they’re serious. Maybe it’s ironic. It’s definitely unapologetic.

The whole thing eventually degrades into yet another ride on the “what do we REALLY think of Duke Nukem?” rollercoaster.

25:00 DARK SOULS 2

If you only listen to one 80′s sitcom-style song about Dark Souls 2, make sure it’s THIS one!

30:00 If one Marvel hero was set up on a blind date with one DC hero, what would be the most interesting pairing?

35:00 Talking about Dark Souls 2 again.

<p>[two paragraphs of lengthy bitching and moaning redacted]</p>
<p>…until it all turned green and fell off. But I’m nearly back to normal now. In the meantime, the kids did the show without me. I’m listening to the show for the first time as I write this, so we’re going to experience this together.</p>
<p>Let’s do this:</p>
<p>Hosts: <a href="http://www.jamesonwhiskey.com/us/agegate">Josh</a>, <a href="http://www.chocolatehammer.org/">Rutskarn</a>, <a href="http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/">Chris</a>, and <a href="http://digitalmumbles.com/">Mumbles</a>.</p>
<p>Show notes:</p>
<p><span id="more-22938"></span><strong>2:00 Chris has entered the strange world of mobile gaming. He’s playing <a href="http://www.gameloft.com/mobile-games/jurassic-park/">Jurassic Park</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Really? The game is just called “Jurassic Park”? Not “Jurassic Park: Mobile” or “Jurassic Park: Reviving Previously Extinct Species to have them Fight to the Death in a sick and Decadent Pit-Fight in the Name of Animal Cruelty Because Obviously”? Nothing to distinguish it from the movie, or the hundreds of other games that have also failed to do justice to the Jurassic Park mythos? No?</p>
<p>Okay then.</p>
<p><strong>9:00 Chris is playing <a href="http://rustysrealdealbaseball.nintendo.com/">Rusty’s Real Deal Baseball</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>18:30 Mumbles has been learning The Console Gaming.</strong></p>
<p>Specifically, she’s been playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Defense_Force_2017">Earth Defense Force 2017</a>. After that she’s going to play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asura%27s_Wrath">Asura’s Wrath</a>, which I gather is a videogame of some sort.</p>
<p><strong>29:00 Apparently we digressed into Hearthstone at some point? That’s the new card game thing, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>32:00 Josh is playing Dark Souls 2 and <a href="http://www.strongholdkingdoms.com/">Stronghold Kingdoms</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>48:00 The Star Wars Extended Universe is not recognized as canon by Disney.</strong></p>
<p>I am not surprised by this. J.J. Abrams rebooted ALL OF STAR TREK, and I suspect it was partly because he didn’t want to have to do a hundred hours of research every time someone pushed a button in the movie. He’s not my first choice for either franchise, and he’s never going to give us a <em>Wrath of Khan</em> or an <em>Empire Strikes Back</em>. But in my book he’s like Michael Bay except he knows to to make a movie. It might be cheap, disposable entertainment, but at least it holds together as a cohesive story with proper character beats. And I’ll take ridiculous LENS FLARE over incomprehensible, puke-inducing shaky-cam any day.</p>
<p>Hang on. After I typed that last paragraph I remembered that Abrams just made Star Trek Into Darkness, and it <em>did</em> try to re-create Wrath of Khan, and it <em>wasn’t</em> a cohesive story at all. I haven’t watched it, but that’s what I heard, anyway. Did I just bolster my position before destroying it? I don’t know. I report. You deride.</p>
<p>ANYWAY.</p>
<p>This might be for the best. Abrams strikes me as not the best person to manage the intersection of dozens of films and books. He’s not a detail guy, and he would probably just infuriate fans if he actually tried to build on existing extended universe canon. It’s far better for him to be up front and honest about what he’s doing so we can go in with our expectations properly calibrated.</p>
<p><strong>1:00:00 Shouldn’t the show be about over by now? Are we still talking about Star Wars? </strong></p>
<p>NERDS!</p>
<p><strong>1:03:00 Josh isn’t kidding. <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ice_Cream_Maker_Guy">Here is the guy with the ice cream maker</a>.</strong></p>

      <itunes:summary>I wasn’t on the show this week because I was sick and had…

[two paragraphs of lengthy bitching and moaning redacted]

…until it all turned green and fell off. But I’m nearly back to normal now. In the meantime, the kids did the show without me. I’m listening to the show for the first time as I write this, so we’re going to experience this together.

Let’s do this:

Hosts: Josh, Rutskarn, Chris, and Mumbles.

Show notes:

2:00 Chris has entered the strange world of mobile gaming. He’s playing Jurassic Park.

Really? The game is just called “Jurassic Park”? Not “Jurassic Park: Mobile” or “Jurassic Park: Reviving Previously Extinct Species to have them Fight to the Death in a sick and Decadent Pit-Fight in the Name of Animal Cruelty Because Obviously”? Nothing to distinguish it from the movie, or the hundreds of other games that have also failed to do justice to the Jurassic Park mythos? No?

Okay then.

9:00 Chris is playing Rusty’s Real Deal Baseball.

18:30 Mumbles has been learning The Console Gaming.

Specifically, she’s been playing Earth Defense Force 2017. After that she’s going to play Asura’s Wrath, which I gather is a videogame of some sort.

29:00 Apparently we digressed into Hearthstone at some point? That’s the new card game thing, right?

32:00 Josh is playing Dark Souls 2 and Stronghold Kingdoms.

40:00 Rutskarn is playing Planescape Torment.

For the record: Yes, I played through Planescape Torment. You lightweights.

48:00 The Star Wars Extended Universe is not recognized as canon by Disney.

I am not surprised by this. J.J. Abrams rebooted ALL OF STAR TREK, and I suspect it was partly because he didn’t want to have to do a hundred hours of research every time someone pushed a button in the movie. He’s not my first choice for either franchise, and he’s never going to give us a Wrath of Khan or an Empire Strikes Back. But in my book he’s like Michael Bay except he knows to to make a movie. It might be cheap, disposable entertainment, but at least it holds together as a cohesive story with proper character beats. And I’ll take ridiculous LENS FLARE over incomprehensible, puke-inducing shaky-cam any day.

Hang on. After I typed that last paragraph I remembered that Abrams just made Star Trek Into Darkness, and it did try to re-create Wrath of Khan, and it wasn’t a cohesive story at all. I haven’t watched it, but that’s what I heard, anyway. Did I just bolster my position before destroying it? I don’t know. I report. You deride.

ANYWAY.

This might be for the best. Abrams strikes me as not the best person to manage the intersection of dozens of films and books. He’s not a detail guy, and he would probably just infuriate fans if he actually tried to build on existing extended universe canon. It’s far better for him to be up front and honest about what he’s doing so we can go in with our expectations properly calibrated.

1:00:00 Shouldn’t the show be about over by now? Are we still talking about Star Wars?

NERDS!

1:03:00 Josh isn’t kidding. Here is the guy with the ice cream maker.

Also, still talking about Star Wars.

1:08:00 We’re talking about Guy Fieri now. For some reason.

I had no idea who this guy was until Chris brought him up.

Star Wars and Homestuck and Guy Fieri?!? What is happening?

Also, there is Homestuck spoilers in this segment. Whatever THAT means.

1:11:00 CURSE YOU JOSH!

Here is the image Rutskarn shared at the end of the show. You’re… welcome?

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Hey, guys, it’s Rutskarn. This story speaks for itself–it’s about a total shitshow of a GM who ran the most incompetent campaign I’ve ever participated in. It is not the worst campaign I’ve ever <i>heard</i> of, but to clear that hurdle it’d need to involve literal felonies, so never mind.</p>
<p>Hosts: <a href="http://www.jamesonwhiskey.com/us/agegate">Josh</a>, <a href="http://www.chocolatehammer.org/">Rutskarn</a>, and <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale">Shamus</a>.</p>
<p>Just in case your palate needs scrubbing, I’ll be around to answer any questions about running or playing tabletop roleplaying games that you’ve got for me in the comments. I’ve got hundreds of hours of GMing experience (in fact, nearly a hundred hours of experience GMing <em>only at charity events</em>), so generally speaking I know what I’m talking about.</p>
<p>Ask whatever you’d like. I should get to most of them within a day or so, but I’ll plug away until I’ve hit ‘em all.</p>

Dear Diecast,The Unreal Engine 4 launched recently, with a very interesting pricing model. A flat monthly subscription fee and 5% off the top is an amazing direction to go in compared to their previous pricing models and removes the barrier to entry for indie developers.

<p>Show notes:<span id="more-22813"></span></p>
<p><strong>1:20 Josh is playing FTL: Advanced Edition.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=17335" title="FTL: Random vs. Skill">My write-up on FTL is here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>8:00 Chris is playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbheiGx0-A">Disney Magical World</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>13:00 Chris is also playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qsdIveYJ0Y">Actual Sunlight</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Interesting that this is the <a href="http://www.depressionquest.com/">second</a> game about depression I’ve run into in the last few months.</p>
<p>Personal talk:</p>
<p>I’ve had days where I woke up and found I couldn’t feel joy or happiness or even contentment. Where nothing felt worth doing. The usual fire I had to consume and talk about games (or do anything else) was just… <em>gone</em>. There was never any reason for this. Everything was fine in my life, aside from the fact that my mood was unaccountably mis-calibrated. I don’t know that this is anything like the clinical depression that some people talk about, but I use it as a frame of reference. My episodes always blow over after a few days and don’t linger for weeks or months on end.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether this is depression or not, it’s certainly an interesting phenomena. We tend to assume that our moods are linked to our situations, and it can be completely baffling and frustrating when that connection is broken. <em>I have no reason to be sad right now. So why am I sad?</em></p>
<p>Having never played either game myself, I do wonder what the intent behind them is. Are they a way for people suffering from depression to feel some sort of connection with each other? Is this a way of saying “You are not alone” to others? Or is this intended to share the experience with people who have never been through it and don’t understand what it’s like?</p>
<p>I wish I’d asked Chris during the show, but I’d love to hear from anyone who has played either game.</p>
<p><strong>15:00 Shamus is working on programming. But not Good Robot.</strong></p>
<p>Stuff I’m working on / thinking about:</p>
<p>1) GLSL shading language. 2) Systems which are incredibly robust with regards to consistency of framerate. 3) Different techniques for offloading CPU work onto the graphics card.</p>
<p>Maybe we’ll talk about this later in the week. Maybe not. I still need to finish my write-up on Thief.</p>
<p><strong>16:00 <a href="http://www.civilization.com/#trailer">Civilization: Beyond Earth</a> has been announced. So we spend a bunch of time talking about Alpha Centauri.</strong></p>
<p>This topic gets derailed by religion in games. If you want to skip that, jump ahead to somewhere around the 37 minute mark.</p>
<p><strong>26:00 Surprise mid-podcast mailbag!</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>What do you think about religion in video games as a mechanic and why is Christianity not as explored as Greek and North mythology?</p><p>-Adrian</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>34:00 We talk about Jade Empire.</strong></p>
<p><strong>37:00 And back to Civilization.</strong></p>
<p><strong>44:00 Mailbag!</strong></p>

      <itunes:summary>Hosts: Josh, Chris, and Shamus.

Show notes:

1:20 Josh is playing FTL: Advanced Edition.

My write-up on FTL is here.

8:00 Chris is playing Disney Magical World

13:00 Chris is also playing Actual Sunlight.

Interesting that this is the second game about depression I’ve run into in the last few months.

Personal talk:

I’ve had days where I woke up and found I couldn’t feel joy or happiness or even contentment. Where nothing felt worth doing. The usual fire I had to consume and talk about games (or do anything else) was just… gone. There was never any reason for this. Everything was fine in my life, aside from the fact that my mood was unaccountably mis-calibrated. I don’t know that this is anything like the clinical depression that some people talk about, but I use it as a frame of reference. My episodes always blow over after a few days and don’t linger for weeks or months on end.

Regardless of whether this is depression or not, it’s certainly an interesting phenomena. We tend to assume that our moods are linked to our situations, and it can be completely baffling and frustrating when that connection is broken. I have no reason to be sad right now. So why am I sad?

Having never played either game myself, I do wonder what the intent behind them is. Are they a way for people suffering from depression to feel some sort of connection with each other? Is this a way of saying “You are not alone” to others? Or is this intended to share the experience with people who have never been through it and don’t understand what it’s like?

I wish I’d asked Chris during the show, but I’d love to hear from anyone who has played either game.

15:00 Shamus is working on programming. But not Good Robot.

Stuff I’m working on / thinking about:

1) GLSL shading language. 2) Systems which are incredibly robust with regards to consistency of framerate. 3) Different techniques for offloading CPU work onto the graphics card.

Maybe we’ll talk about this later in the week. Maybe not. I still need to finish my write-up on Thief.

16:00 Civilization: Beyond Earth has been announced. So we spend a bunch of time talking about Alpha Centauri.

This topic gets derailed by religion in games. If you want to skip that, jump ahead to somewhere around the 37 minute mark.

26:00 Surprise mid-podcast mailbag!

What do you think about religion in video games as a mechanic and why is Christianity not as explored as Greek and North mythology?-Adrian

34:00 We talk about Jade Empire.

37:00 And back to Civilization.

44:00 Mailbag!

Dear Diecast/ShamusSo we’re familiar with your stance on graphics resources.  After reading your recent article on the Oculus Rift, do you think the “graphics arms race” is (truly) relevant again in the games industry because of VR?~Ian

Amazing question. I’d already been thinking about this it for a while when the question showed up, so I had a lot to say about it.

Dear Diecast,Do you find international perspectives on games to be interesting? For example, is Diecast irregular Jarenth valuable for his Dutch-ness as well as his Jarenth-ness?Cheers,Neil from England

Let me plug Jarenth here while I have an excuse.

42:00 MAILBAG!

After seeing the Machine for Pigs episode, I felt I should ask: What’s the most minimalistic game that you enjoyed enough to recommend? Conversely, what’s the most complex game that you can recall engrossing you?-Rueben

Shamus chronicles his development adventures quite well for us, but what about the rest of you? Have you dabbled in game development at all and what did you think?Even that stupid text adventure you wrote in high school could be fun to talk about.-Taylor

This is my favorite question in ages. It turns out all of us have dabbled in game development. Also I talk a bit about the programming I’ve been doing lately.

I’m sure this topic will come up in the show itself, but I figured I’d try to make sure of it.What do you guys think about Facebook buying Occulus?  I mean, a global megacorporation that knows everything about everyone taking over the industry leader in virtual reality is basically the setup for almost every cyberpunk setting ever, right?- Ed (Kavonde)

<p>Mild spoilers.</p>
<p><strong>12:00 OOPS FEMINISM</strong></p>
<p>It’s hard to stop talking about this subject once you get started. For me the compelling thing is the completely anarchic and asymmetrical nature of the debate. This isn’t a two-sided war between people who want female protagonists and people who don’t. This is a multi-faceted debate where extremists tend to get the most attention. There are a lot of different types of “feminists” (who might not even self-identify as feminists<span class="snote" title="1">I don't self-identify as one, but I've been called one. Labels are dangerous things and the LAST thing I want is another argument over what the word "feminist" means.</span>) who just want more female protagonists. Then there are angry people who think that sexy characters are inherently destructive and that enjoying some T&amp;A makes you a horrible person. Then the other side fails to draw a distinction between these two positions and hilarity ensues. Add in a handful of really ugly, Angry Young Men who spew hate and threats. Then have the feminist side<span class="snote" title="2">And remember, this side is actually several sides that don't all self-identify as feminist.</span> paint all of the opposition as if they were in league with – and sympathetic to – the Angry Young Men. Add in a couple of layers of counter-backlash to either side and suddenly it’s really hard to understand how such a simple idea can generate so much outrage.</p>
<p>This complete mayhem creates a desire from people like me to clear up this confusion. Maybe I can’t settle the debate, but maybe I can at least help the various sides understand the complexity of the conflict? But no. My efforts never help and I just end up being yet another idealistic idiot shouting into the storm. And so it goes.</p>
<p>Rutskarn mentioned this post from <a href="http://susanarendt.com/2014/03/04/why-titanfalls-launch-trailer-made-me-emotional/">Susan Arendt on the Titanfall trailer</a>.</p>
<p>We also talk about women being integrated into the US Navy. This is such a sad topic for me. There are a lot more anecdotes like the one I told. The problem is that the whole subject is dripping with politics, and even people doing the right things are often doing them in the wrong way and for the wrong reasons. For reference, these events happened around 1991 through 1993. (My brother was in boot camp when the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailhook_scandal">Tailhook scandal</a> took place.) I don’t know how the Navy is doing these days, but the early days of co-ed service were a complete mess. I could fill several pages with stories about how completely dysfunctional the service was and about how ugly and unfair (to both genders) integration was.</p>

      <itunes:summary>So let’s have a nice, calm, non-controversial week talking abo- aw damn it someone mentioned feminism again, didn’t they? Let me get my crash helmet on.

Hosts: Rutskarn, Mumbles, Josh, Chris, and Shamus.

Show notes:

4:00 Mumbles completed Broken Age.

Mild spoilers.

12:00 OOPS FEMINISM

It’s hard to stop talking about this subject once you get started. For me the compelling thing is the completely anarchic and asymmetrical nature of the debate. This isn’t a two-sided war between people who want female protagonists and people who don’t. This is a multi-faceted debate where extremists tend to get the most attention. There are a lot of different types of “feminists” (who might not even self-identify as feministsI don&#x27;t self-identify as one, but I&#x27;ve been called one. Labels are dangerous things and the LAST thing I want is another argument over what the word &quot;feminist&quot; means.) who just want more female protagonists. Then there are angry people who think that sexy characters are inherently destructive and that enjoying some T&amp;A makes you a horrible person. Then the other side fails to draw a distinction between these two positions and hilarity ensues. Add in a handful of really ugly, Angry Young Men who spew hate and threats. Then have the feminist sideAnd remember, this side is actually several sides that don&#x27;t all self-identify as feminist. paint all of the opposition as if they were in league with – and sympathetic to – the Angry Young Men. Add in a couple of layers of counter-backlash to either side and suddenly it’s really hard to understand how such a simple idea can generate so much outrage.

This complete mayhem creates a desire from people like me to clear up this confusion. Maybe I can’t settle the debate, but maybe I can at least help the various sides understand the complexity of the conflict? But no. My efforts never help and I just end up being yet another idealistic idiot shouting into the storm. And so it goes.

Rutskarn mentioned this post from Susan Arendt on the Titanfall trailer.

We also talk about women being integrated into the US Navy. This is such a sad topic for me. There are a lot more anecdotes like the one I told. The problem is that the whole subject is dripping with politics, and even people doing the right things are often doing them in the wrong way and for the wrong reasons. For reference, these events happened around 1991 through 1993. (My brother was in boot camp when the Tailhook scandal took place.) I don’t know how the Navy is doing these days, but the early days of co-ed service were a complete mess. I could fill several pages with stories about how completely dysfunctional the service was and about how ugly and unfair (to both genders) integration was.

36:00 Rutskarn is working on Unrest and playing Alpha Protocol.

39:30 Chris is prepping for GDC and playing Titanfall

48:00 Shamus is playing Borderlands 2 again, and also playing Path of Exile.

Also we briefly discuss Race the Sun.

55:30 Josh has begun playing The Walking Dead Season 2.

56:00 Josh is playing Dark Souls.

Here is the Dark Souls Critical Close-up Chris mentioned.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Here is an entire episode dedicated to a single game. Thief [4] has been a long time coming. Some have been excited to see it return. Some hopeful. Some outraged. Some resigned. But now we’ve played it and we can see the result for ourselves.</p>
<p>It’s not the game we hoped for, but neither is it the train wreck we feared.</p>
<p>Hosts: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt">Josh</a>, <a href="http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/">Chris</a>, and <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale">Shamus</a>.</p>
<p>The entire show is about Thief, so no timestamps. We spoil some of the themes of the story during the show, but nothing that shouldn’t be incredibly obvious after the tutorial.</p>
<p>At the 57-minute mark we talk about the ending, so you might want to skip that part if you’re spoiler-averse.  Although as Chris says, the story is pretty much broken, and I don’t think spoilers will hurt you. And by “broken” I mean, “clearly a patchwork of different revisions of the story that don’t fit together or form a proper sequence of events”.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode was recorded AFTER our <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?page_id=16386">Spoiler Warning</a> session this week, but it’s being released first. We were a little tired and a couple of hosts short by the time we got to this point.</p>

<p><strong>1:00 Shamus is playing Elder Scrolls Online and EVE Online.</strong></p>
<p>We can’t talk about ESO yet. (Embargoed until Feburay 7th.) But we can talk about <a href="http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/the-bloodbath-of-b-r5rb/">the battle of B-R5RB</a>. Note that we had this conversation before I did the homework for <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=22139">my recent EVE post</a>.</p>
<p><strong>28:00 We move on from EVE and talk about space games more broadly.</strong></p>
<p>Like I said in the show, there are a lot of space games on the way.

<p>Did I miss any?</p>
<p><strong>34:00 Chris is playing Call of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Juarez:_Gunslinger">Juarez: Gunslinger</a>.</strong></p>
<p>We only cover this briefly. Not because there’s nothing to talk about, but Rutskarn already went over this a couple of months ago.</p>
<p><strong>38:30 Chris is also playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bureau:_XCOM_Declassified">The Bureau: XCOM Declassified</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/comics/stolen-pixels/7435-Stolen-Pixels-186-Well-Lookie-Who-We-Have-Here">Here’s the rant</a> (and comic) that I wrote about this game way back in 2010, when it was still in development.

      <itunes:summary>This episode was recorded AFTER our Spoiler Warning session this week, but it’s being released first. We were a little tired and a couple of hosts short by the time we got to this point.

Hosts: Josh, Chris, and Shamus.

Show notes:

1:00 Shamus is playing Elder Scrolls Online and EVE Online.

We can’t talk about ESO yet. (Embargoed until Feburay 7th.) But we can talk about the battle of B-R5RB. Note that we had this conversation before I did the homework for my recent EVE post.

28:00 We move on from EVE and talk about space games more broadly.

Like I said in the show, there are a lot of space games on the way. Check it out: Blockade Runner, Elite: Dangerous, Felix Vast, Kerbal Space Program, Kinetic Void, Limit Theory, The Mandate, No Man’s Sky, Pulsar: Lost Colony, Rodina, Space Engineers, Star Made, Starbound, Star Citizen, and Starpoint Gemini 2.

Did I miss any?

34:00 Chris is playing Call of Juarez: Gunslinger.

We only cover this briefly. Not because there’s nothing to talk about, but Rutskarn already went over this a couple of months ago.

38:30 Chris is also playing The Bureau: XCOM Declassified

Here’s the rant (and comic) that I wrote about this game way back in 2010, when it was still in development. Here’s the Polygon Article Chris mentioned: The many faces of the bureau: xcom declassified: from 2006 to 2013

This conversation got sidetracked into…

43:00 Another Mass Effect rant? Really? REALLY?

I blame Chris.

53:00 Mailbag!

We talk about Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition and about Steam Early Access program and the difficulties of defining when a game is “done”.

Request: When you send us a question (the address is in the splash image at the top of the post) please put “Diecast” in the title so Josh can find them when we finally get around to reading them.

Also Shamus gives “marriage advice” on the occasion of his 17th wedding anniversary.

11:00 Josh is playing the game Adobe Premiere Doesn’t Friggin’ Work Dammit Hell Shit.

Josh also talks about a Crusader Kings II succession game he’s talking part in. For the uninitiated, CKII is a strategy game where you guide a particular dynasty through the ages.

22:30 Chris kicks off a discussion about Nintendo, the Wii U and their troubled sales.

Nintendo projected 9 million Wii U’s sold, but when the numbers came in it was more like 2.5 million. Now they’re in a tough spot.

Here is the article I mentioned. In the article we learn:

<p>Show notes:</p>
<p><span id="more-21987"></span><strong>01:00 Shamus got over his Skyrim problem and made screensaver.</strong></p>
<p>For the record, the mods I was using are <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26228/?">Realistic Needs &amp; Diseases</a>, <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11163/?">Frostfall</a>, and <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25404/?">Random Alternate Start</a>, along with about 40 others.</p>
<p>I already talked about the screensaver <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=21977" title="Passage Screensaver">earlier this week</a>.</p>
<p><strong>13:00 The Elder Scrolls Online</strong></p>
<p>Here is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZUynhkal1I" title="TUN: The Elder Scrolls VI - Youtubia">Nerdrage video on Elder Scrolls</a>.</p>
<p><strong>51:30 Chris is writing things and talking about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbv9rs9bVOE">Alien Isolation</a>.</strong></p>
<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien:_Isolation">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Alien Isolation] is set in 2137, 15 years after the events of Alien and 42 years before the events of Aliens. It focuses on Ellen Ripley’s daughter Amanda who, while in search for her mother, goes to a space station: Sevastopol, unaware that the Xenomorphs have already infested the place.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whaaat?</p>
<p>So you’re playing as Ripley’s daughter. Who is an adult. Not only does this muck with establish canon, but it drags in a character that was better left where she was: Having lived a perfectly mundane and unremarkable life on Earth.</p>
<p>A much better idea? Let us play as Newt. You wouldn’t have to screw with any existing lore, and the mechanics are all right there in the movie: Newt survives by hiding in tight spots and using her wits. She can crawl through the duct work and watch the Aliens tear through the colonists. We’ve got a huge installation to work with and lots of blank space on the timeline. It would be a very cat-and-mouse type stealth, where the tension comes from the times when you’re obliged to leave the safety of the vents and venture into the open to accomplish something.</p>
<p>I’m not saying it can’t be a great game, but the whole “Ripley’s daughter” thing smacks of ham-handed fanfiction.</p>
<p>Having said that: This is the first Alien game in ages that sounds promising. Survival stealth? Oh yeah. I’m on board with that.</p>

13:00 The Elder Scrolls Online

Here is the Nerdrage video on Elder Scrolls.

51:30 Chris is writing things and talking about Alien Isolation.

From Wikipedia:

[Alien Isolation] is set in 2137, 15 years after the events of Alien and 42 years before the events of Aliens. It focuses on Ellen Ripley’s daughter Amanda who, while in search for her mother, goes to a space station: Sevastopol, unaware that the Xenomorphs have already infested the place.

Whaaat?

So you’re playing as Ripley’s daughter. Who is an adult. Not only does this muck with establish canon, but it drags in a character that was better left where she was: Having lived a perfectly mundane and unremarkable life on Earth.

A much better idea? Let us play as Newt. You wouldn’t have to screw with any existing lore, and the mechanics are all right there in the movie: Newt survives by hiding in tight spots and using her wits. She can crawl through the duct work and watch the Aliens tear through the colonists. We’ve got a huge installation to work with and lots of blank space on the timeline. It would be a very cat-and-mouse type stealth, where the tension comes from the times when you’re obliged to leave the safety of the vents and venture into the open to accomplish something.

I’m not saying it can’t be a great game, but the whole “Ripley’s daughter” thing smacks of ham-handed fanfiction.

Having said that: This is the first Alien game in ages that sounds promising. Survival stealth? Oh yeah. I’m on board with that.

<p><strong>2:00 Rutskarn is playing the Saints Row 4.</strong></p>
<p>We talk about the series, compare the humor to GTA, discuss the the “romance scenes”, and talk about choice and Mass Effect.</p>

<p><strong>28:00 Shamus is playing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m7rmb3QrN8">The Novelist</a>.</strong></p>
<p>This is a game all about balancing creative work with family life. Like I said in the show: I found a lot of meaning in the game, but it depicts a problem we spent years dealing with. I’m curious if it holds the same appeal for someone that hasn’t been through this.</p>
<p><strong>42:00 Josh is playing the <a href="http://www.worldofys.com/ysc/">Ys Chronicles</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>46:00 Rutskarn recaps the <a href="http://forthechildrenandstuff.tumblr.com/">Aunty Paladins</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>1:02:00 Chris talks about his <a href="http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/?p=603">Patreon campaign</a>.</strong></p>
<p>I find this <em>incredibly encouraging</em>. I might give this topic a post of its own, but the short version is that by sponsoring a show directly, the money ends up in the hands of the people who make the content we love. Compare this to the old model where:</p>
<ol><li>Acme buys advertising space on YouTube.<p></p></li><li>The ad runs on a video made by Bob.</li><li>Carla clicks on the ad. (Probably by accident, if my own surfing habits are any indication.)</li><li>YouTube gives a tiny little bit of the advertising money to Bob.</li></ol>
<p>And all too often:</p>
<ol><li value="5">Actually, some jackass copyright troll flags Bob as producing infringing content and siphons off some of his revenue while Bob spends time disputing the claim instead of making more content.</li></ol>
<p>Acme can’t tell where their ad shows up or who will see it in this madcap YouTube world.  YouTube doesn’t care about the quality of Bob’s show as long as people watch it. Bob doesn’t care about Acme as long as he gets his money. When Carla clicks, it’s not because she likes Bob’s show, but because she’s ostensibly interested in Acme. The parties all have goals that are either completely unrelated or even in conflict.</p>
<p>It’s an awful system, and the only reason we’re using it is because we don’t have anything better. Services like Subbable and Patreon might be a way to route around this madness.</p>
<p>Like Errant Signal? Want to encourage it? <a href="http://www.patreon.com/errantsignal">You can support it here</a>. And as Chris is quick to say: <em>The show will continue whether you give or not.</em> Giving is your way of saying, “Dear internet. Make more stuff like this.”</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Happy new year! Rather than doing a big year-end retrospective, we talked about the here &amp; now like we usually do.</p>
<p>Note that I produced this episode. Josh usually does it, but he’s visiting his parents and doesn’t have access to his normal equipment. So any complaints about the audio quality should be directed at me. Note also that I make about two episodes a year, so your complaints won’t do any good because I end up re-learning the whole process from scratch every time.</p>

<p>To be clear, I don’t know if gargling with alcohol is medically useful for killing throat-based infections, but it FEELS like it helps. The only reason I doubt it is: If all you needed to do to kill throat cultures was gargle alcohol, wouldn’t they have figured it out ages ago? Wouldn’t this just be standard procedure for sore throats?</p>
<p>As an aside: How could you do a proper <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment">double-blind</a> study on this? With most tests, you can easily administer a placebo without detection. But the test subject is going to feel that alcohol in their throat and the control subject won’t, and that sensation is going to skew the results. I don’t know. I  think the best solution is for us to make a field trip to the liquor store and begin what I’m calling a “blind drunk trial”.</p>
<p>Given how good it feels, I can’t believe this treatment doesn’t go all the way back to the middle ages.</p>
<p><strong>8:30 Josh got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_TIE_Fighter">Tie Fighter</a> working on his tablet, using a 360 controller with <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/">Dos Box</a>.</strong></p>
<p>This is madness. Awesome madness.</p>
<p><strong>9:00 Josh is playing <a href="http://projectzomboid.com/">Project Zomboid</a></strong></p>
<p>We throw out the term “offsite SVN” without explaining it.  For the record, SVN is a system for keeping track of source code. An offsite one is a place where you can upload your code so that even if your computer gets hit by an asteroid, you still have a complete record of your code, your documentation, and the history of the project. VERY useful. I use <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a>.</p>
<p>Also, I claimed I was a “one man operation”, which is completely untrue. I have Peter Olson going over my revisions and making sure it all works on Linux.</p>

You’re welcome.

Hosts: Rutskarn, Josh, Chris, and Shamus.

Show notes:

18:30 Frozen

We’re talking about the recent Disney movie. Here’s the MovieBob review I mentioned.

25:00 Rustkarn is playing Shadowrun Returns.

30:00 Rutskarn also finished Skyrim.

This completes his multi-game play-through of the Elder Scrolls series.

40:30 Shamus is playing Batman: Arkham Origins and Starbound.

48:00 We stop the podcast for a minute to watch the trailer for No Man’s Sky, and then come back to share our reactions.

During this segment I said that there’s no way this is an indie project by four people. In this RPS interview it sounds like the team is actually four people.

57:30 Josh picked up a bunch of Steam sale games, so we talk about Chivalry and Godus and Europa Universalis.

1:40:00 Chris is playing Need for Speed: Rivals and Long Live the Queen.

But sometimes you have to give a game the thrashing it deserves. This week is a reckoning for a handful of misbegotten indies.

Hosts: Rutskarn, Josh, Mumbles, Chris, and Shamus.

Show notes:

1:30 Josh played Home.

In the process of discussing the game and the horror genre in general, we talk about 7th Guest and the recent 7th Guest 3 Kickstarter.

20:00 Chris is playing Batman: Arkham Origins and Battlefield 4.

We also spend some time talking about good ol’ Team Fortress 2 and how the game has changed.

35:00 Shamus has been playing indie games. The Void, Spelunky, and Eldrich.

Of these three games: He praises one, complains about a second, and hates on the third. But not in that order.

49:00 Mumbles has been playing Batman: Arkham Origins.

Here is an in-depth discussion about the new Batman game from Mumbles.

1:00:00 Rutkarn has played The Wolf Among Us and Typing of the Dead: Overkill.

Here is the story about how Typing of the Dead was made (sort of) in six weeks, salvaged by a team that believed in it.

<p>Show notes:<span id="more-21496"></span></p>
<p><strong>1:00 The public health hazards of fun-size candy bars.</strong></p>
<p><strong>7:15 THE STANLEY PARABLE. </strong></p>
<p>While the stuff we discuss are spoilers in the technical sense, I don’t know if we’re actually likely to ruin any surprises. I’m not even sure the conversation will make sense. We might say nonsense things like, “Did you get the toaster ending? When the siren went off I didn’t know where to go, but then that door opened up and the narrator did the thing with the wastebasket.” It’s gibberish to someone who hasn’t played.</p>
<p>The point being, this section is either:</p>
<p>1) Terrible, terrible spoilers.<br /> 2) Annoying impenetrable nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>14:00 Batman: Arkham Origins</strong></p>
<p>We also briefly digress into talking about the new Saint’s Row DLC.</p>
<p><strong>27:00 Okay, I lied. We didn’t actually spoil the Stanley Parable in that earlier segment. </strong></p>
<p>This segment is also free of Stanley Parable spoilers.</p>
<p><strong>39:00 We will not be discussing the Stanley Parable in this segment.</strong></p>
<p>Actually, I lied again.  The previous segment is packed with Stanley Parable spoilers. It’s brimming with them.  In fact, I don’t think you could get a greater density of spoilers than what we had in the last segment. This segment is safe, though.</p>
<p>Instead we talk about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jRcYY3c344">Gas Guzzlers Extreme</a>.</p>
<p><strong>44:00 Rutskarn’s Great Voyage Through all the Elder Scrolls Titles</strong></p>
<p>He’s taking playing through all the games, in order, with the same character. (Inasmuch as that’s even possible to have the “same” character in such a mechanically diverse series.)</p>
<p><strong>1:11:11 MAILBAG!</strong></p>
<p>We talk about BioWare and LGBT characters.</p>

27:00 Okay, I lied. We didn’t actually spoil the Stanley Parable in that earlier segment.

This segment is also free of Stanley Parable spoilers.

39:00 We will not be discussing the Stanley Parable in this segment.

Actually, I lied again.  The previous segment is packed with Stanley Parable spoilers. It’s brimming with them.  In fact, I don’t think you could get a greater density of spoilers than what we had in the last segment. This segment is safe, though.

Instead we talk about Gas Guzzlers Extreme.

44:00 Rutskarn’s Great Voyage Through all the Elder Scrolls Titles

He’s taking playing through all the games, in order, with the same character. (Inasmuch as that’s even possible to have the “same” character in such a mechanically diverse series.)

1:11:11 MAILBAG!

We talk about BioWare and LGBT characters.

<p>Show notes: <span id="more-21208"></span></p>
<p><strong>1:00 Shamus is annoyed with how the game Brothers ended.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SPOILERS!</strong> We go on to compare other well-known downer endings and talk about what makes an ending work and what doesn’t. We talk about The Walking Dead, Mass Effect 3, and Brothers. It was impossible to have this conversation without a few spoilers.</p>
<p>I still recommend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers:_A_Tale_of_Two_Sons">Brothers</a>, and I recommend spoiling the ending first.</p>
<p><strong>7:45 Mumbles is Birthday-ing this week. She’s also playing GTA V.</strong></p>
<p><strong>22:00 Here we ramble our way into talking Borderlands 2. </strong></p>
<p><strong>26:30 Josh talks a little bit about his experience playing Good Robot.</strong></p>
<p><strong>31:30 Talking about Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>34:00 Rutskarn is playing <a href="http://www.ftlgame.com/">FTL</a> and <a href="http://www.gunpointgame.com/">Gunpoint</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>53:00 Mailbag!</strong></p>
<p>In talking about Dreamfall, I referenced <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=682">my old rant on the end of the game</a>. Check it out:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m sure fans of the game will be quick to point out that this is the second act in a three-act play. Great. The first installment came out in 1999. Adventure games and budgets being what they are, there is no guarantee that the next game will even be made. And even if it is, I don’t really care to wait for it. In another seven years I’ll be 42, my oldest daughter will be getting ready to turn 16, and I will only have a vague memory of what happened in this game.</p></blockquote>
<p>Correct on all counts. I’m 42, my daughter is about to turn 16, and I barely remember the game aside from being angry at the end. Also relevant is <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=1006">this ancient post on why I dislike episodic games</a>.</p>

<p>Josh is playing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QP5X6fcukM">Papers, Please</a>. And as a reminder, later today he’ll be playing <em>Rome II, Complete and Absolute War</em>.</p>
<p>Mumbles left Guild Wars 2 for the Old Republic. She’s also playing <a href="https://www.themightyquest.com/en">Quest for Epic Loot</a>, but it’s in closed beta and she can’t talk about it.</p>
<p>Chris is playing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LYfCs5bfyI">Saint’s Row IV</a> and <a href="https://infinity.disney.com/?cmp=KNC|INFINITY|Pre-Order|GGL|G_Media-Ad||Media-Ads-Toy-Box-Trailer||Disney-Infinity-Exact|WDPR-Global-Media|||">Disney Infinity</a>.</p>
<p>Shamus has been playing <em>Papers, Please</em> and <em>Saints Row IV</em>. During this segment Chris mentioned <a href="http://www.davidsgallant.com/igtced.html">I get this call Every Day</a>.</p>
<p>Rutskarn is playing Gone Home.</p>
<p><strong>00:37:00 A talk about game duration vs. the pricetag of the game.</strong></p>
<p><em>Shamus tells a long rambling story about how game prices relate to the airplane ride he took as a kid.</em></p>
<p><strong>41:00 Rustkarn talks about Crusader Kings II</strong></p>
<p><strong>45:00 Sim City Online has <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/427268/launch-issues-blight-simcity-release-on-mac/">troubled launch on Macs</a>.</strong></p>
<p>It really is amazing how this game can continue to find new ways to fail.</p>
<p><strong>51:00 Mumbles talks about Dragon Age 3</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>1:00:00 Somewhere around this point we segue into talking about focus testing and the way it (should) shape games.</strong></p>
<p>We compare the changes made to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYowhad_1mw">Overstrike</a> to the changes made in Portal 2.</p>

Show notes:  02:00 What’s the Happy-haps?

Josh is playing Papers, Please. And as a reminder, later today he’ll be playing Rome II, Complete and Absolute War.

Mumbles left Guild Wars 2 for the Old Republic. She’s also playing Quest for Epic Loot, but it’s in closed beta and she can’t talk about it.

Chris is playing Saint’s Row IV and Disney Infinity.

Shamus has been playing Papers, Please and Saints Row IV. During this segment Chris mentioned I get this call Every Day.

Rutskarn is playing Gone Home.

00:37:00 A talk about game duration vs. the pricetag of the game.

Shamus tells a long rambling story about how game prices relate to the airplane ride he took as a kid.

41:00 Rustkarn talks about Crusader Kings II

45:00 Sim City Online has troubled launch on Macs.

It really is amazing how this game can continue to find new ways to fail.

51:00 Mumbles talks about Dragon Age 3.

1:00:00 Somewhere around this point we segue into talking about focus testing and the way it (should) shape games.

We compare the changes made to Overstrike to the changes made in Portal 2.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We don’t talk about Gone Home in this episode, but we wanted to. We do spend the first segment of the show talking about how we reacted to the game. I don’t know if it’ll get its own one-off special, or if we’ll just give it a couple of weeks so people can play through it. But I will say the response from the cast is universally positive.</p>

<p>Shamus is playing Gone Home, <a href="http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/games/avww-features">Valley Without Wind</a>, and <a href="http://kairo.lockeddoorpuzzle.com/">Kairo</a>. (I called it “Kairos” throughout this segment. In my defense, a friend of mine owned a coffee shop called Kairos and saying “Kairo” is like trying to say “Borderland”. It’s hard to make my mouth stop before the s!) But mostly coding.</p>
<p>Rutskarn is playing the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble Origin Bundle</a>.</p>

In other news: Someone suggested that putting the fully qualified URL to the audio in the RSS feed would help the Diecast show up for podcasting software.  I have done this. I’m sure you’ll let me know if it helped.

Hosts: Shamus, Josh, and Mumbles, Chris but not Rutskarn.

Show notes:

02:30 What’s everyone doing?

20:00 Warren Spector: Where’s Gaming’s Roger Ebert?

45:30 Pacific Rim. (And then Rutskarn shows up and we talk about random things for 15 minutes.

58:30 Mumbles talks comics!

1:17:30 Mailbag.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Some behind-the-scenes info: We generally forward news stories to each other all week. When Sunday rolls around, we take the headlines for the week, sort them out, and figure out which ones we want to talk about and which ones we don’t. Then we record the show.</p>
<p>This week we had nothing. Not one news story. I don’t know if we weren’t following the news or we didn’t care, but we had no stories and nothing to say. We just got together for our once-a-week blather session and Josh began recording halfway through. That means this podcast is even less structured than last week. Just so you know what you’re getting into. In any case, the choice was between this and nothing.</p>
<p>We’ve got a good slate of stories now, so the Diecast should return to normal next week. In the meantime, you’ve been warned:</p>
<p>Hosts: Shamus, Josh, Rutskarn, Mumbles, Chris</p>
<p>Show notes:</p>
<p><span id="more-20279"></span><strong>00:00</strong> No introductions. No host. No news items. NO HOPE.</p>
<p><strong>00:30</strong> We join the podcast in mid-conversation, talking about <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1022603/">500 Days of Summer</a> and Scott Pilgrim. For reference, <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=8999" title="Scott Pilgrim vs. MY FACE">here is what I had to say about Scott Pilgrim when it came out</a>. The <a href="http://moviebob.blogspot.com/">MovieBob</a> video <a href="http://www.chocolatehammer.org/" title="Chocolate Hammer">Rutskarn</a> mentioned is here: <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/the-big-picture/7373-Dumping-Irony" title="The Big Picture: Dumping Irony">The Big Picture: Dumping Irony</a>.</p>
<p><strong>09:30</strong> We troll <a href="http://digitalmumbles.com/">Mumbles</a> by not talking about Batman. Instead we talk about Green Lantern, The Aristocrats, and Tacos.</p>
<p><strong>15:00</strong> <a href="http://www.scribblenauts.com/scribblenauts/unmasked">Scribblenauts</a></p>
<p><strong>24:00</strong> Josh is playing Skyrim. Mumbles video on Skyrim is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84WvpwyEJw8" title="The Mumbles Problem: Skyrim">here</a>. Then we segue into talking about Fallout: New Vegas</p>
<p><strong>52:30</strong> MAILBAG! We discuss sharing the hobby, the Kinect, and visual fidelity and game budgets.</p>
<p>Also, I want to apologize to Neil (or Neal) who sent in the long question. While short questions are always better than long in this format, that’s no reason for me to be a jerk about it. Bad form. In my defense, we’d been at this for a couple of hours by this point and I was getting a bit frazzled.</p>
<p>If you’ve got a question for the cast, send it to diecast@shamusyoung.com. Also: Short questions make for better launching points for conversation. Long questions are better left in the comments. (I used to have a special page where people could leave long questions for me to answer. Looks like it got culled last time I tinkered with the site. I’ll look into bringing that back.)</p>

      <itunes:summary>This was a bit of an odd week for us. Not a lot of playing games and not a lot of news. (That interested us.) But the show must go on. And really, “I have to talk about videogames but I’m not completely prepared” is about the most awesome problem you can have in this life.

Hosts: Shamus, Josh, Rutskarn, Chris, Jarenth.

Additional note: I mentioned before that the new season of Spoiler Warning would begin this week. Various technology problems have pushed that back. We’re basically throwing out our entire production pipeline for Spoiler Warning and starting over. We’ll try again next week.

23:00 It’s the triumphant return of “Bad SimCity News of the week”! You can get free SimCity DLC by buying specially-marked boxes of toothpaste or whatever. At least it’s not Doritos and Mountain Dew this time.

Which one did we discuss playing through Half-Life 2: Episode 3? Was that Diecast #230? No, 230 was when we discussed Sony’s inexplicable decision to design the Playstation 5 with a cotton-candy pink case.”</p>
<p>Then again, I have no idea how to title long multi-topic discussions in a memorable way. Screw it. We’ll just kick this problem on down the road and let future-us deal with it.</p>
<p>Show notes:</p>
<p><strong>00:15</strong> Intro. What’s everyone doing?  Shamus is playing Max Payne 3. (I suppose I might as well link to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU0dgjon10U" title="A Day in the Life of Max Payne">that one Max Payne video</a> before someone beats me to it.) Rutskarn is playing KOTOR2. Chris is playing <a href="https://www.digipen.edu/?id=1170&amp;proj=25930">Perspective</a>. Josh is playing…</p>
<p><strong>17:00</strong> Tomb Raider. The new one. Like, the reboot. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCKHlO9C7Lc">This one</a>.</p>
<p><strong>40:00</strong> SimCity. Man, does this story have legs or what? We recorded this on Sunday night, and here on Thursday the follies continue. Sadly, this means a lot of the stuff we discussed or speculated about has now been resolved or rendered moot, only to be replaced by new failures. The latest? <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/03/12/simcity-server-not-necessary/" title="Maxis Insider Tells RPS: SimCity Servers Not Necessary">Maxis Insider Tells RPS: SimCity Servers Not Necessary</a>.</p>
<p>This reminds me so much of the ages-old <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=1290" title="Bioshock: Miss Misinformation">BioShock controversy</a>: A polite spokeswoman is way out of her technical depth and saying things that the tech-savvy users prove to be untrue, thus making inflaming the people they were trying to pacify. Those who do not learn from history, etc. (They are also repeating the mistakes of the Diablo III launch and the Assassin’s Creed 2 launch. So, nice going EA. You are the very last idiot to make this particular blunder.)</p>
<p><strong>1:03:30</strong> The Blip.tv story. <a href="http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/?p=467" title="Errant Signal">Here is what Chris posted about it</a>. And here is the original post where I hurled bricks at the company after too many trips through the same advertisement: <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=12158" title="Blip.TV Sucks">Blip.tv Sucks</a>.

40:00 SimCity. Man, does this story have legs or what? We recorded this on Sunday night, and here on Thursday the follies continue. Sadly, this means a lot of the stuff we discussed or speculated about has now been resolved or rendered moot, only to be replaced by new failures. The latest? Maxis Insider Tells RPS: SimCity Servers Not Necessary.

This reminds me so much of the ages-old BioShock controversy: A polite spokeswoman is way out of her technical depth and saying things that the tech-savvy users prove to be untrue, thus making inflaming the people they were trying to pacify. Those who do not learn from history, etc. (They are also repeating the mistakes of the Diablo III launch and the Assassin’s Creed 2 launch. So, nice going EA. You are the very last idiot to make this particular blunder.)

1:03:30 The Blip.tv story. Here is what Chris posted about it. And here is the original post where I hurled bricks at the company after too many trips through the same advertisement: Blip.tv Sucks. Stay classy, Shamus.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>With Shamus out for the week, I host and Jarenth guest stars on this exciting installment of the Diecast!</p>
<p>And now for the show notes, complete with the oft-requested timestamps!</p>
<p>00:15 – We talk about what we’ve been doing for the past week. Shamus is a zombie, Chris is a Tomb Raider, Rutskarn is Homestuck, Jarenth’s lost in Echo Bazaar, and I’ve been set on the Path of Exile.</p>
<p>15:55 – Everything and more about the Playstation 4 announcement, and in particular, the implication that “more polygons = stronger emotional connection.” And if you don’t want to watch the whole thing, VideoGamerTV made a helpful <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJDn0jRnUQ">abridged version of the conference</a> that has basically everything that’s important in it.</p>
<p>33:00 – We discuss the closure of Civilization World and what it can tell us about the state of Social Games, and how it compares to a similar collapse of the MMO space.</p>
<p>48:00 – Crytek jumps on the free-to-play bandwagon and is also very bad at naming things. We also talk about Cevat Yerli’s <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/28/crytek-reveals-the-many-faces-of-free-to-play?">statement</a> that “…the notion of a single-player experience has to go away.”</p>
<p>1:02:15 – Round Table Discussion: Are the Elder Scrolls games getting better or worse?</p>
<p>1:18:00 – We round out the podcast with the Assassin’s Creed 4 announcement. I hope you like pirates, because… uh… well I’m not really sure where the hell they’re going with this. Assassins and pirates? Are we going to finally see a video game about pirates versus ninjas? I don’t know, but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3jKH5peHt8">here’s the announcement trailer.</a></p>

      <itunes:summary>There’s this long-running joke among the Spoiler Warning cast. When we’re getting ready to record the show, we frequently get sidetracked talking about other stuff.  Sometimes for hours. Then eventually one of us will say, “You know what? We should do a podcast.” This joke ran so long that we actually went and did it.

Embedded using HTML5. It either works or it doesn’t:

Discussion:

What’s everyone playing?Next gen backwards compatibility unlikely says random analyst.Last of Us Squeezes Every Last Drop of Power From PS3.FarCry 3 is a worse game than FarCry 2?Star Wars Free-for-all: Disney owns Star Wars, JJ Abrams directing next SW movie, Obsidian pitching new Star Wars game, and new Star Wars 1313 game.

The odds of us making more of these is directly proportional to how many people are interested in this one.
