45:53 Mailbag: Phantom Menace

Hello Shamus and Paul,
This month marks the 20th anniversary of the Phantom Menace, the first of the Star Wars Prequel Movies. 
I’ve read lots of articles looking back at it and how the fans’ opinion of it has changed over the years. Some started legitimately enjoying it while others still see the bad but enjoy it due to the campy acting and pretty visuals. 
My question is, how did you view the Phantom Menace back in 1999 and has your opinion changed since then? 
A lot of the articles and video documentaries also talk about how ‘the generation that grew up with the prequels’ is remembering them more fondly than fans who grew up with the Original Trilogy. Do your kids think differenly about the prequels as well? How do they view things like Jar Jar, all the Senate scenes etc. ? 
Sincerely,
Lucas

      <title>Diecast #256: Framerate, Satisfactory, Metro Exodus</title>
      <link>https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=47072</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[
		<p>Welcome to Diecast #2<sup>8</sup>. Honestly, it seems like a waste to keep going after hitting such a sweet landmark. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=18831">The first episode of the Diecast</a> was posted on February 14, 2013. Most episodes run just slightly over an hour, but occasionally they run to 1.5 hours and very rarely they approach 2. If we assume the average length is an hour and 20 minutes, then there are 341 hours of Diecast. That’s almost exactly two solid weeks of talking about videogames. I don’t know why you’re not sick of me by now, but I’m glad this is working.</p>

<p>Show notes:<span id="more-47072"></span></p>
<p><strong>00:33 Shamus recants regarding framerate.</strong>  </p>
<p>If you want to test for yourself, you can view <a href="https://www.testufo.com/framerates-marquee#count=3&amp;pps=1200">this page</a>, which should show you images moving at various framerates. I know this isn’t quite the same as viewing a whole-frame 3D image, but it’s enough to illustrate what I’m talking about.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m never going back. </p>
<p>I remember going through the same thing when we made the jump from 16 bit color to 32 bit color. At the start I thought 16 was fine and 32 was a needless luxury for obsessive people. Then after getting used to 32 bit I used a machine that was still using a late-90s 16 bit card and I thought it looked <strong>awful</strong>. The difference looks something like this:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>If you’re storing the color values in just 16 bits, then you’ve got 4 bits for red, 4 bits for green, 4 for blue, and 4 for alpha. There were other packing schemes that took some of the bits from the alpha channel or gave extra bits to green where we’re most sensitive to color changes, but the basic problem of color banding remains. Of course, the problem is exacerbated by this photo-realistic image. Then again, the problem is slightly mitigated by the high resolution of the image. The banding would look a lot more severe if this image was 800×600 or even 640×480. </p>
<p>The point is, color depth was one of those things that seemed extravagant until I had it, and then it became a necessity. It seems like high framerates is a similar deal.</p>
<p>I promise I’ll try to avoid turning into a full-on framerate snob in the future.</p>
<p><strong>06:01 SatisFactory is the worst corridor shooter.</strong></p>
<p>BUT CAN YOU ROCKET JUMP?</p>
<p><strong>12:50 Issac Broke Risk of Rain</strong> </p>
<p>Issac began taking screenshots as soon at the problem began to manifest. Below is the first shot, before things got really out of control. In the lower right is a box with the number 16 in it, which is how many seconds until the ability fires again and summons four more drones. On the left is a vertical list saying “Strike Drone” over and over again (mixed in with some other random minions he had) to show how many have been summoned so far. In the middle of the screen you can see a bunch of floating yellow triangles. Each triangle marks the location of a drone. All the debris is from the mass of monsters that drones just wiped out.</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>Thirty seconds later, things had gotten out of control. You can see the drone list is overwhelmed. In the lower corner, notice that the cooldown says it’s now -1308 seconds until the ability fires again. This means the ability was probably firing every frame or every game tick, depending on how things are set up.</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>From here, it just got worse. You can see the cooldown is now negative eleven thousand. Also, I’m pretty sure the screen is pure white because there are so many overlapping particle effects that they saturated the entire scene.</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>Looking at this now, I see the timestamp (upper right corner) in the above shot is a few seconds before the previous shot. Sorry. It’s hard to make sense of the screenshots and the exact timing of everything. Issac was attempting to flee the area while running at 1 frame a second, so most of the screenshots are just random chaos like you see above. Anyway, you get the idea.</p>
<p><strong>19:00 Metro Exodus</strong>  </p>
<p>I was going to get some screenshots of this in action, but I didn’t think to get out my phone and take pictures of my keyboard to go with them.</p>
<p>I’m curious if everyone else has the same impression I do. Didn’t it seem like this game came and went really quickly? Do you think that’s do to it being an Epic Store exclusive, or because the game itself just didn’t connect with people?</p>
<p><strong>25:32 Issac is using Hammer Editor.</strong></p>
<p>Issac has informed me that the slowdown only happens when the level is <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Leak">properly sealed</a>, and doesn’t seem related to the lighting. (Also, putting it on fast compile shortens the wait to a few seconds.) I still have many questions. Issac’s level is geometrically simple – it’s just a series of box rooms connected by corridors. I was building those kinds of levels on a 166Mhz PC back in the 1990s, and that same BSP operation for a level of the same complexity was under half a minute.</p>
<p>So what is Hammer<span class="snote" title="1">Actually, the BSP process is handled by a command-line program (WHAT YEAR IS IT?) invoked by Hammer called VBSP.</span> doing with 15 minutes of modern-day computing power?!?</p>
<p><strong>33:55 Mailbag: Engine Building Games</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Your discussion on Risk of Rain prompted me to finally play the copy I’ve had for a shameful amount of time. I’ve realised that what it really feels like is an engine building game. Different genre – ish, but I put Slay the Spire in the same box.</p>
<p>Engine builders tend to be board games where victory comes from setting up an ‘engine’ with interacting cards or resources and running it. The interactions may make other interactions stronger, or deal with their negative effects, or allow them to trigger more frequently – much like in RoR how your son finds game breaking combos,  or infinite damage loops in Spite. Usually, games like Scythe, London and some ways of playing Magic fell into this category.</p>
<p>Have you found any other similar engine building experiences on PC? My current damage exploding Borderlands 2 Psycho feels a bit that way,  as well as more commonly in tycoon games. Occasionally,  Michael Brough’s games too. </p>
<p>With great affection, </p>
<p>Lachlan</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>39:10 Mailbag: New Dwarf Fortress</strong>  </p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Hi! I recently saw that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/03/13/dwarf-fortress-premium-version/">a new version Dwarf Fortress</a> is coming to Steam and itch.io. The game will also have graphics, and support Steam Workshop upgrades. My question is: do any of you plan on playing it (I know Paul’s had some experience with it), and do you think it can supplant its competition in the face of Rimworld, Factorio, Satisfactory and the like? Also, how appealing would it be to someone who’s never played it?</p>
<p>Keep being Awesome,<br>
Lino</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>44:20 Mailbag: Re-playing games vs. New Games</strong>  </p>
<blockquote><p>Hey Shamus and Paul,</p>
<p>Do you ever find yourself returning to older games that you have played<br>
many times before, even if they’re not great, instead of playing new games that you would most likely enjoy?</p>
<p>I’ve been re-reading your Mass Effect retrospective, and it really makes me want to go back and play the through the trilogy again for the 3rd time, even though I have a huge backlog of games that I own and have never played, including some that I’m sure I would like if I ever played them.</p>
<p>I think there’s a level of comfort involved with playing an older game. You know exactly what to expect, with regards to both the mechanics and the story. I feel like I sometimes suffer from “new game fatigue” where I want to play a new game, but as soon as I start it, I realize that I have to learn a new system and mechanics, and I just don’t feel like putting in the effort. It feels like with most games these days, especially RPGs and strategy games, there’s a huge learning curve just to get to the point where you feel like you feel like you know what you are doing. It’s easier to just load up a game you’ve played before and not have to work too hard. Maybe it’s part of being older as well and having less time to dedicate toward playing games. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the subject.</p>
<p>Jason</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>48:54 Cities Skylines Boring Start</strong></p>
<p>This was an unplanned aside. Actually, I think it deserves an entire article. The early game has so many of these frustrating obligations that force you to build a stupid broken city that you’ll have to tear apart and fix later. You can fix this by using a mod to unlock all the stuff you need up front, but then you start the game with the entire city demanding all these different services at once, when you don’t have enough money to meet those needs. You can fix this with more mods, but after a while it feels like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV:_Oblivion">Oblivion</a> problem where you’re trying to re-balance an entire game by stringing together disparate mods.</p>

      <itunes:summary>Welcome to Diecast #28. Honestly, it seems like a waste to keep going after hitting such a sweet landmark. 

The first episode of the Diecast was posted on February 14, 2013. Most episodes run just slightly over an hour, but occasionally they run to 1.5 hours and very rarely they approach 2. If we assume the average length is an hour and 20 minutes, then there are 341 hours of Diecast. That’s almost exactly two solid weeks of talking about videogames. I don’t know why you’re not sick of me by now, but I’m glad this is working.


Hosts: Paul, Shamus. Episode edited by Issac.

Show notes:

00:33 Shamus recants regarding framerate.  

If you want to test for yourself, you can view this page, which should show you images moving at various framerates. I know this isn’t quite the same as viewing a whole-frame 3D image, but it’s enough to illustrate what I’m talking about.

Anyway, I’m never going back. 

I remember going through the same thing when we made the jump from 16 bit color to 32 bit color. At the start I thought 16 was fine and 32 was a needless luxury for obsessive people. Then after getting used to 32 bit I used a machine that was still using a late-90s 16 bit card and I thought it looked awful. The difference looks something like this:




If you’re storing the color values in just 16 bits, then you’ve got 4 bits for red, 4 bits for green, 4 for blue, and 4 for alpha. There were other packing schemes that took some of the bits from the alpha channel or gave extra bits to green where we’re most sensitive to color changes, but the basic problem of color banding remains. Of course, the problem is exacerbated by this photo-realistic image. Then again, the problem is slightly mitigated by the high resolution of the image. The banding would look a lot more severe if this image was 800×600 or even 640×480. 

The point is, color depth was one of those things that seemed extravagant until I had it, and then it became a necessity. It seems like high framerates is a similar deal.

I promise I’ll try to avoid turning into a full-on framerate snob in the future.

06:01 SatisFactory is the worst corridor shooter.

BUT CAN YOU ROCKET JUMP?

12:50 Issac Broke Risk of Rain 

Issac began taking screenshots as soon at the problem began to manifest. Below is the first shot, before things got really out of control. In the lower right is a box with the number 16 in it, which is how many seconds until the ability fires again and summons four more drones. On the left is a vertical list saying “Strike Drone” over and over again (mixed in with some other random minions he had) to show how many have been summoned so far. In the middle of the screen you can see a bunch of floating yellow triangles. Each triangle marks the location of a drone. All the debris is from the mass of monsters that drones just wiped out.




Thirty seconds later, things had gotten out of control. You can see the drone list is overwhelmed. In the lower corner, notice that the cooldown says it’s now -1308 seconds until the ability fires again. This means the ability was probably firing every frame or every game tick, depending on how things are set up.




From here, it just got worse. You can see the cooldown is now negative eleven thousand. Also, I’m pretty sure the screen is pure white because there are so many overlapping particle effects that they saturated the entire scene.




Looking at this now, I see the timestamp (upper right corner) in the above shot is a few seconds before the previous shot. Sorry. It’s hard to make sense of the screenshots and the exact timing of everything. Issac was attempting to flee the area while running at 1 frame a second, so most of the screenshots are just random chaos like you see above. Anyway, you get the idea.

19:00 Metro Exodus  

I was going to get some screenshots of this in action, but I didn’t think to get out my phone and take pictures of my keyboard to go with them.

I’m curious if everyone else has the same i…</itunes:summary>

		<p>Welcome to Diecast #2<sup>8</sup>-1! Just a heads up: This episode is basically me talking frantically for an hour while Paul does his best to squeeze in the occasional sentence fragment. If you’re here for me, then this should be fun. If you’re here for a conversation, then I have failed you.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure what to do about <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> spoilers. The whole movie is a barrage of surprises and fanservice, so trying to talk about Endgame without spoilers is like trying to talk about Tombstone without mentioning cowboys. You <strong>can</strong> do it, but in the end it’s a lot of trouble for a very dubious benefit. I did my best to avoid giving away the big surprises, but you should probably just go see the movie if you’re spoiler-shy. You know how the internet is when people get excited. You’re bound to blunder into a spoiler pretty soon.</p>

<p><strong>50:53 Mailbag: Starcraft Lore</strong>  </p>
<blockquote><p>Hey Diecasters,</p>
<p>As I’ve been wrapping up my second tabletop campaign set in the Starcraft universe (using the Starfinder system, from the makers of Pathfinder, made from the d20/D&amp;D 3.5 system), I’ve realized how much I appreciate Starcraft lore from a gaming perspective. Have you ever done in-depth dives of Starcraft? I feel like there’s something to be said for the games’ story…not so much that the plot is all that amazing, but the tone is astonishingly pitch-perfect, and puts the player pretty deep in the world despite the generic characters and plot. Your own mileage may vary, do you have games that you’re unimpressed with story-wise but that really do it for you in terms of tone and world-feel?<br>

<p>Show notes: <span id="more-46683"></span><br>
<strong>00:20 Ubisoft’s Just Dance Unlimited</strong></p>
<p>For the record, <em>Just Dance Unlimited</em> is a service you sign up for in addition to buying the game. You don’t need the service to play the game, but if you get the service then you’ll have more dances to do. In addition to the problems I talked about on the show, Heather had additional annoyances she told me about the next morning:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the box, it promises that Just Dance Unlimited offers “over 400” songs. On the website, the sales pitch for JDU claims “over 200”. Then in the game proper, it says “over 300”. And at no time can you ever see a list telling you what you’ll get.</li>
<li>Every time she selected a song, the game claimed it couldn’t connect to the Ubisoft servers. (Our internet was otherwise working perfectly, so it’s doubtful the problem was on our end.) She could play some songs, but others would give these odd network errors.</li>
<li>After rebooting the Wii U, the game said she needed to create an Ubisoft account. That’s reasonable enough, but then why didn’t it ask for that up front? Why did it let her play parts of the game and give strange network errors if the real problem was it required an account? Did anyone test this?</li>
<li>There’s a high score feature. On one of the songs the game said she got the highest score. You’d think it would say this for ALL songs, since she’d never played any of them before. But she got the highest score on just one. So is this some public / global high score table? If so, it’s kind of useless since there was no indication of how many other people were playing or had ever played any of these songs.</li>
<li>The game records video of you dancing, with no way to turn it off. She eventually just covered up the Wii U camera.</li>
<li>The game awards you in some bullshit points or whatever. You then use this junk currency to pay for spins on a slot machine, and that’s how you unlock new content. Imagine you’re out for a jog and you have to stop every three minutes and play with a slot machine on your phone. That should give you an idea of how awkward and unwelcome this feature is.</li>
<li>The slot machine is very flashy. My wife has to look away from the screen because it gives her a headache.</li>
<li>It’s obvious they didn’t really have a lot of content for the slot machine. Like, new icons for yourself, or new titles for your character.</li>
<li>Aside from the slot machine, you also unlock other things through playing the game. She won things like THE HOME SCREEN and THE ABILITY TO MAKE PLAYLISTS. You know, basic features.</li>
</ul>
<p>She loves Just Dance, but she described this experience as being “So very Ubisoft.”</p>
<p><strong>09:40 Paul’s New Computer</strong></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>Here are <a href="http://peripheralarbor.com/gallery/v/Projects/Computer/">some pictures of the machine in progress</a>.</p>
<p><strong>27:44 Captain Marvel and Avengers Endgame</strong></p>
<p>I know it’s a rule on the internet that every single time someone reviews a movie with a woman lead that it needs to be a referendum on gender politics, but can we <strong>not</strong> do that this time? Can we just like / not like movies without framing dissenters as members of some great horrible Other?</p>
<p>It would be great if we could do that. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>42:35 Mailbag: Bad games making WORSE games look better.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hello Shamus and Paul,</p>
<p>I recently had a conversation with a friend about Fallout 76, specifically about how it makes Fallout 4 look a lot better by comparison. No (or really less) game breaking bugs, better experience due to an actual in-game narrative and overall just more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Thing is, I had almost the same conversation a few years ago. But back then it was about Fallout 4 vs Fallout 3. And how Fallout 4 makes Fallout 3 look a lot better by comparison. Things like an actual skill system, the dialog system and a plot that at least, had a clear villain (The enclave… and your dad).</p>
<p>I guess one thing that’s at work here is constrast effect (eg. Well… at least it’s not fallout 4…). That and nostalgia (eg. The newer game just might not evoke that same feeling as the previous game).</p>
<p>But I think it’s wierd that games like Fallout 3 or Mass Effect 3 (when compared with Andromeda) Suddenly get this status as ‘secretly great all along’ while nothing about the game has changed, only something came along that’s ‘worse’.</p>
<p>I guess my question is, what are your thoughts on this phenomenon? Did you ever look back on a game you played years ago and think ‘hmmm actually it’s not as bad’ when compared with newer games (in the franchise) and later realised you still kind of felt the same about it?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Paul</p></blockquote>

<p>Thanks! ET</p></blockquote>
<p>I feel like we didn’t do this topic justice because I got sidetracked and dragged us WAY off-topic here. Sorry about that.</p>

Show notes: 
00:20 Ubisoft’s Just Dance Unlimited

For the record, Just Dance Unlimited is a service you sign up for in addition to buying the game. You don’t need the service to play the game, but if you get the service then you’ll have more dances to do. In addition to the problems I talked about on the show, Heather had additional annoyances she told me about the next morning:


On the box, it promises that Just Dance Unlimited offers “over 400” songs. On the website, the sales pitch for JDU claims “over 200”. Then in the game proper, it says “over 300”. And at no time can you ever see a list telling you what you’ll get.
Every time she selected a song, the game claimed it couldn’t connect to the Ubisoft servers. (Our internet was otherwise working perfectly, so it’s doubtful the problem was on our end.) She could play some songs, but others would give these odd network errors.
After rebooting the Wii U, the game said she needed to create an Ubisoft account. That’s reasonable enough, but then why didn’t it ask for that up front? Why did it let her play parts of the game and give strange network errors if the real problem was it required an account? Did anyone test this?
There’s a high score feature. On one of the songs the game said she got the highest score. You’d think it would say this for ALL songs, since she’d never played any of them before. But she got the highest score on just one. So is this some public / global high score table? If so, it’s kind of useless since there was no indication of how many other people were playing or had ever played any of these songs.
The game records video of you dancing, with no way to turn it off. She eventually just covered up the Wii U camera.
The game awards you in some bullshit points or whatever. You then use this junk currency to pay for spins on a slot machine, and that’s how you unlock new content. Imagine you’re out for a jog and you have to stop every three minutes and play with a slot machine on your phone. That should give you an idea of how awkward and unwelcome this feature is.
The slot machine is very flashy. My wife has to look away from the screen because it gives her a headache.
It’s obvious they didn’t really have a lot of content for the slot machine. Like, new icons for yourself, or new titles for your character.
Aside from the slot machine, you also unlock other things through playing the game. She won things like THE HOME SCREEN and THE ABILITY TO MAKE PLAYLISTS. You know, basic features.

She loves Just Dance, but she described this experience as being “So very Ubisoft.”

09:40 Paul’s New Computer




Here are some pictures of the machine in progress.

27:44 Captain Marvel and Avengers Endgame

I know it’s a rule on the internet that every single time someone reviews a movie with a woman lead that it needs to be a referendum on gender politics, but can we not do that this time? Can we just like / not like movies without framing dissenters as members of some great horrible Other?

It would be great if we could do that. Thanks.

42:35 Mailbag: Bad games making WORSE games look better.

Hello Shamus and Paul,
I recently had a conversation with a friend about Fallout 76, specifically about how it makes Fallout 4 look a lot better by comparison. No (or really less) game breaking bugs, better experience due to an actual in-game narrative and overall just more enjoyable.
Thing is, I had almost the same conversation a few years ago. But back then it was about Fallout 4 vs Fallout 3. And how Fallout 4 makes Fallout 3 look a lot better by comparison. Things like an actual skill system, the dialog system and a plot that at least, had a clear villain (The enclave… and your dad).
I guess one thing that’s at work here is constrast effect (eg. Well…</itunes:summary>

22:03 Everything is Early access

Are more games being released in Early Access, or am I just playing an unusual number of them? I don’t even know how you’d go about giving a definitive answer to this.

28:04 Paul’s New Computer

In this segment, I sort of take a swipe at the idea of limiting “screen time” for kids. This Penny Arcade strip pretty much sums up how I feel about it. It wasn’t until later that I remembered that this is an incredibly controversial argument in the parenting scene. My wife Heather runs a parenting group on Facebook, and this is one of those topics that always seems to start a fire.

For the record, this is just what worked for our family. Every kid is different. Do what you think is right. I don’t think you’re a bad parent if you do something different.

That’s what Paul has ordered. We’ll let you know how it goes next week.

I’m still using the machine that was gifted to me back in 2013. I’ve upgraded the graphics card since then and replaced a few other parts, but I’m still using the same CPU / Mobo.

<p><strong>09:25 Email Mystery</strong></p>
<p>I left <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=41629">1&amp;1 Hosting</a> and got a <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=43338">new host</a> last summer. The Diecast mail server was still located at something like <code>gibberish.mail.1and1.com</code>. I don’t understand how sending something <code>@shamusyoung.com</code> would end up with it winding up on the 1and1 server. What should have happened was that the mail system should have looked up my domain, found it at A2Hosting, attempted to deliver it, and then failed because the <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" >[email&nbsp;protected]</a> address wasn’t set up at the new host. </p>
<p>Instead email went to the new host, even though routing shouldn’t put it there. The emails were stored, even though the account is long closed. Gmail was able to retrieve them, even though that login should no longer work.</p>
<p>Gmail was actually telling me that it was having trouble checking the email, but then I’d get email from the Diecast mailbox. I just… I can’t explain it. </p>
<p>I’m sure there’s a logical explanation to all of this, but I’m too lazy to think about it. As soon as I start pondering the insanity of 1&amp;1, my brain wants to do literally anything else.</p>

34:06 Mailbag: Phoenix Point Controversy

Dear Diecast,
There is currently quite a bit of drama surrounding Phoenix Point, an upcoming kickstarter founded XCom-like. As it turns out Epic paid them a handsome sum (I heard 2 million dollars) for a one year exclusivity deal on the Epic Store. A LOT of the backers don’t want to have anything to do with the Epic Launcher which they consider shady, and are furious about it and ask for refunds. Unlike for Metro the Phoenix Point people don’t have steam/gog keys at all to give.
What do you fellas think about it, are they overreacting, are this a form of bait&amp;switch, am I just using reddit drama to get a cool Overload key?

53:26 Mailbag: Mass Effect and Planning Ahead

Dear Diecast,
I recently replayed Mass Effect 1 and could not help but notice how vague the conversation with Sovereign was — more “I am the vanguard of your destruction” and less “You are creating too much dark energy, so we are going to off ya”.
What is your opinion on my uninformed speculation that the writers might have not planned out the series as well as they should have in the beginning? Perhaps Mass Effect 2 and 3 were just a result of writers’ shortsightedness, what do you think?
In case you want more questions, here’s another — Recently, I read the story that was originally intended for Destiny.

Of course, almost none of it made it into the final game but it did made me think: have you heard of any other stories that got canned because they were too “weird” or “out there”?

		<p>It’s a bit of a weird one this week, I’m afraid. Paul and I both bought vehicles and the resulting conversation ate a third of the show. On the other hand, we’re giving away a free copy of a game, so maybe that makes up for all the car talk. Details at the end of the show / show notes.</p>

<strong>00:00 Shopping for Vehicles</strong></p>
<p>The thing I forgot to mention is that the new car has about double the fuel economy. Our poor minivan was a bit of a lush, and keeping it fueled was enormously expensive. By my rough estimate, the new car will save us about $1,000 a year on fuel alone.</p>
<p><strong>17:52 Broken Peripherals</strong></p>
<p>I’m too lazy to take photos of the new keyboard in situ, but here is one lifted from the store page:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>Given how much of my day I spend typing, getting a new keyboard is a pretty big deal for me.&nbsp;I’m still in the early phase of keyboard adoption where I’m making a lot of mistakes.</p>
<p>The new KB is just different enough from the old that it’s taking some time to adapt. I’m used to a double-height return key. The backslash isn’t where I expect it. I’m used to a gap of empty space between the function keys and everything else. The new keyboard has a new (to me) key that seems to behave like a right-click, and that’s a little weird to my way of thinking. This extra key means the space bar is a little narrower, and I’m not crazy about that. The right control doesn’t work unless you also hold down FN, and I have no idea what that’s all about.</p>
<p>Instead of a user manual, it came with a piece of paper directing me to the website. That’s fine, inasmuch as I’m into saving trees and it’s not worth printing a full manual for a simple keyboard. Except, the website is long gone<span class="snote" title="1">The scrap of paper indicates this unit was made in 2014.</span> and there’s a domain name<span class="snote" title="2">www.eagletech.com</span> squatter on it now. So that’s disappointing. I’ll probably never know why the right Ctrl key behaves this way.</p>
<p>This is the first time since the early 90s that I’ve had a keyboard with clicky-clack mechanical keys. I forgot how loud these things were. It’s really nice for typing, but it’s obnoxious for gaming. The loud clicking is really distracting when you’re trying to immerse yourself in a game.</p>
<p>Also, I forgot how nice it is to have a keyboard with some <strong>weight</strong>. My last keyboard was a bit light and could gradually migrate to the left during a vigorous gaming session, but this new one is rock solid.</p>
<p><strong>26:40 No Man’s Sky</strong></p>
<p>For those who are new to the site, <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=40413">here is my take on No Man’s Sky a year after release</a> and <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=43366">here is what I thought about it last summer after the NEXT update</a>.</p>
<p><strong>45:47 Satisfactory</strong></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>50:35 Warframe</strong></p>
<p>Fun story: I was playing Warframe while listening to this part of the show. In the middle of the part where I complained that the game summoned the <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Wolf_of_Saturn_Six">Wolf of Saturn Six</a> during a mission, the game did it again. This time it did so during a low-level early-game mission. I was running away from this end-game boss while listening to a podcast where I complained about exactly this problem.</p>
<p>Like I said on the show, I couldn’t take more than two hits from this guy, I had nothing to slow him down, and it took me several minutes to knock a tiny 5% off his massive health bar. <strong>And that was with my best loadout!</strong> This time I had a low-level frame and some weak weapons, so defeating him was a physical impossibility.</p>
<p>This really is like having Arthas show up in Westfall, running around one-shotting lowbie players. That’s just <strong>atrocious</strong> game design. It’s really confusing for new players who don’t understand what this guy is and have no idea why they’re suddenly dropping dead in the middle of this supposedly low-level mission.</p>
<p><strong>Shamus, maybe the designers are trying to motivate you to level up enough to fight this guy?</strong></p>
<p>Leveling in this game is pretty slow. It would take months of focused play to reach the level where a fight with this guy would make sense. By that time, this event will be long over.</p>
<p>So maybe you’re thinking that it might be fun to get together with a few friends, equip all your best gear, and gang up on him? Wrong. You can’t fight him at will. He just shows up randomly. Given the way this game is designed, you don’t usually walk around with your best gear. Even if you’ve got gear to deal with him, you probably won’t have it equipped when he shows up.</p>
<p>The designers could have saved themselves a ton of money. Instead of wasting time modeling and animating this boss, just add a heart attack feature to the game. Once every four dozen missions, your character keels over dead, you fail your current mission, and there’s nothing you can do about it. It’s functionally the same but a lot easier to implement.</p>
<p>The punchline? He doesn’t even drop anything amazing. Even if you persevere and spend an hour chipping away at that gargantuan health bar without getting murdered, the odds are he’ll drop one-forth of the blueprints for his weapon. According to the wiki, on average you’d need to fight him ~40 times to get all the blueprints. Since you can’t fight him at will, I don’t think that’s possible even if you play around the clock.</p>
<p>The entire system is so stupidly broken and nonsensical I can’t even tell what the designer was <strong>trying</strong> to do.</p>
<p><strong>1:04:46 Free Key for Overload</strong></p>
<p>If you’d like a key for the Descent-like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/448850/Overload/">Overload</a>, then send us a question for the show<span class="snote" title="3">The email is in the header image.</span>. To avoid getting spammed, let me make some rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re only eligible if your question is actually used on the show, so there’s nothing to be gained from sending the same question 10 times.</li>
<li>This also means that there’s nothing to be gained from sending in random <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgqHCFBXc1w#t=1m54s">nonsense questions</a>.</li>
<li>They key I have is for Steam, so ideally you’ll have some sort of Steam account.</li>
<li>Please mention in the message that you’re interested in the Overload key, just so I don’t send the key to someone who doesn’t want it.</li>
<li>This is probably obvious, but the key will be sent to the email used to send the question. So don’t use a bogus / disposable address or you won’t get your prize.</li>
</ul>

        <![CDATA[
		<p>Last week I asked for mailbag questions, and you delivered. Well, technically the email system is the one that did the delivering, but you get what I’m saying. Here is over an hour of question-answering.</p>
<br>
Hosts: <a href="http://www.peripheralarbor.com/">Paul</a>, <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/">Shamus</a>. Episode edited by <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198087035658/">Issac</a>.<p></p>
<p>Show notes:<span id="more-46161"></span><br>
<strong>00:00 The Clocks Change</strong></p>
<p>I have run out of ways to make fun of this annoying practice. How disappointing.</p>
<p><strong>00:59 Mailbag: Gaming literacy</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast</p>
<p>Do you think that there is such a thing as “gaming literacy” and if so what would the requirements be to be considered “game literate”?</p>
<p>Regards Eric</p></blockquote>
<p>As promised on the show, here is… this:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>09:24 Mailbag: Uplay</strong>  </p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Shockingly, UPlay has recently become a functional piece of software.  You can now buy (using PayPal, even!), download and execute games with it.  Even with my terrible internet connection, I haven’t had any issues with DRM.  What gives?</p>
<p>Admittedly, the only two things you can actually buy on it are The UbiSoft Game and Uno, so the platform remains a bit limited.</p>
<p>Can you think of any other examples of a program or service, which has been completely worthless for the best part of a decade, suddenly becoming competent?</p>
<p>Best wishes, </p>
<p>Geebs</p></blockquote>
<p>During the show, we made a joke that “this show” was an example of something that started out as useless but then became competent. By “this show” I was referring to the specific episode we were recording. Like, it started out as incompetent as evidenced by my butchering of this email.</p>
<p>When listening to the show after editing, I became paranoid that someone might take this the wrong way and assume “this show” was referring to the Diecast as a whole, and we were joking that the show was terrible when I was working with the previous hosts. Just to be clear: That’s not what I was laughing about and I don’t want anyone to think I was throwing shade at my former collaborators.</p>
<p><strong>18:52 Mailbag: Worldbuilding and also…</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hey Shamus and Paul,</p>
<p>quick question about world-building; I find reading the background about Elder Scrolls games fascinating even though it has paper-thin characters and plot; conversely I don’t care about the world in games like Dragon Age and find the exposition very dull (even though traditionally Bioware has been much better at characters) how do you feel about the two? do you think there’s a right way and a wrong way to do world-building in a fantasy setting? </p>
<p>I always suspected it was partly down to books being read like books in TES games, rather than essentially an Amazon Kindle like the codex in Dragon Age, but just curious if you have some more thoughts on this (or perhaps it’s just down to TES lore being really really meta)</p>
<p>if you’re hurting for another question; we all know about the thermal clip situation in Mass Effect. If you had to retcon a gameplay element of a past game, how would you go about it? Try and brush it under the rug, or just own it and run with it?</p>
<p>many thanks guys,<br>
James Stanfield</p></blockquote>
<p>The writer I was thinking of during this segment is <a href="https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Michael_Kirkbride">Michael Kirkbride</a>. Also, here’s the Bob Case video I mentioned:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>30:03 Mechanical Retcons.</strong></p>
<p>This question was part of the previous question.</p>
<p><strong>40:31 Mailbag: Raytracing.</strong>  </p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Do you think raytracing on the GPU in going to take off, or merely something Nvidia added to the RTX line to be a technical gimmick for this generation?</p>
<p>With great affection,</p>
<p>Lachlan</p></blockquote>
<p>In this segment I talked about what graphics hardware I’m using. For the record, I’m using a GeForce GTX 780, which was originally released in 2013. So my graphics hardware turns 6 this year. This is certainly the longest a graphics card has ever lasted for me. </p>
<p>Like I said on the show, I still don’t feel a direct need to upgrade. I’m still using a 1080p monitor, so games look fine and play fine. But I’m considering an upgrade just for the sake of screenshots. I don’t want people to accuse me of being unfair to a game and making it look bad because I’m running it on a potato. </p>
<p>But I don’t think the upgrade is going to happen before summer. We’re a one-car family and our 2003 Toyota just crossed the 200,000 mile threshold. It’s getting really expensive to keep the thing on the road and I’m worried about Heather getting stranded someplace during bad weather. So we have to buy a car before we can buy new graphics hardware.</p>
<p>I know <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=2133">I make fun of how hard it is to shop for graphics hardware</a>, but that’s nothing compared to the stress of buying vehicles. Putting that much money into a single purchase always freaks me out. </p>
<p>So we’re going to have a couple more months of potato-rendered screenshots before I manage to upgrade this thing. Your patience is appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>51:44 Mailbag: Next Console gen.  </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear die casters.</p>
<p>The rumor mill is churning and the reveal of the next console generation draws ever closer. As such, I’d like to ask what you think Sony and Microsoft should do or will do for next gen.</p>
<p>Microsoft have bought a bunch of studios recently, so I think it’s a safe bet that they’ll actually have some video games to sell on their next console. Novel, I know.</p>
<p>Sony on the other hand could very well sit blind on their high horse and blunder through the generation, as they did with the PS3. But if they don’t do that, I hope the rumours of a backwards compatible PS5 is true. Even just PS4 games would be a huge boon for the system. There’s even talk of a console with support for ALL the previous Playstations, which sounds as amazing as it is unlikely.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>
<p>-Victor</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>56:26 Mailbag: Battletech  </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>I’ve been playing Battletech this month.  Because Shamus has also played Battletech (and because you said that the mailbag was empty) I have two very important giant-robot related questions for you.</p>
<p>Question 1:  Gun hands or people hands?</p>
<p>Question 2:  Chicken legs or people legs?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>–John</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>1:00:21 Mailbag: Open-source remakes.  </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast<br>
Have you paid any attention to open-source remakes/clones of old games, such as OpenMW, OpenRA, or OpenXcom? What’s you’re opinion on them and are there any such projects you find particularly interesting, or any games you would particularly want to see remade in this manner? </p>
<p>Regards, Spodah</p></blockquote>

      <itunes:summary>Last week I asked for mailbag questions, and you delivered. Well, technically the email system is the one that did the delivering, but you get what I’m saying. Here is over an hour of question-answering.


Hosts: Paul, Shamus. Episode edited by Issac.

Show notes:
00:00 The Clocks Change

I have run out of ways to make fun of this annoying practice. How disappointing.

00:59 Mailbag: Gaming literacy

Dear Diecast
Do you think that there is such a thing as “gaming literacy” and if so what would the requirements be to be considered “game literate”?
Regards Eric
As promised on the show, here is… this:




09:24 Mailbag: Uplay  

Dear Diecast,
Shockingly, UPlay has recently become a functional piece of software.  You can now buy (using PayPal, even!), download and execute games with it.  Even with my terrible internet connection, I haven’t had any issues with DRM.  What gives?
Admittedly, the only two things you can actually buy on it are The UbiSoft Game and Uno, so the platform remains a bit limited.
Can you think of any other examples of a program or service, which has been completely worthless for the best part of a decade, suddenly becoming competent?
Best wishes, 
Geebs
During the show, we made a joke that “this show” was an example of something that started out as useless but then became competent. By “this show” I was referring to the specific episode we were recording. Like, it started out as incompetent as evidenced by my butchering of this email.

When listening to the show after editing, I became paranoid that someone might take this the wrong way and assume “this show” was referring to the Diecast as a whole, and we were joking that the show was terrible when I was working with the previous hosts. Just to be clear: That’s not what I was laughing about and I don’t want anyone to think I was throwing shade at my former collaborators.

18:52 Mailbag: Worldbuilding and also…

Hey Shamus and Paul,
quick question about world-building; I find reading the background about Elder Scrolls games fascinating even though it has paper-thin characters and plot; conversely I don’t care about the world in games like Dragon Age and find the exposition very dull (even though traditionally Bioware has been much better at characters) how do you feel about the two? do you think there’s a right way and a wrong way to do world-building in a fantasy setting? 
I always suspected it was partly down to books being read like books in TES games, rather than essentially an Amazon Kindle like the codex in Dragon Age, but just curious if you have some more thoughts on this (or perhaps it’s just down to TES lore being really really meta)
if you’re hurting for another question; we all know about the thermal clip situation in Mass Effect. If you had to retcon a gameplay element of a past game, how would you go about it? Try and brush it under the rug, or just own it and run with it?
many thanks guys,
James Stanfield
The writer I was thinking of during this segment is Michael Kirkbride. Also, here’s the Bob Case video I mentioned:




30:03 Mechanical Retcons.

This question was part of the previous question.

40:31 Mailbag: Raytracing.  

Dear Diecast,
Do you think raytracing on the GPU in going to take off, or merely something Nvidia added to the RTX line to be a technical gimmick for this generation?
With great affection,
Lachlan
In this segment I talked about what graphics hardware I’m using. For the record, I’m using a GeForce GTX 780, which was originally released in 2013. So my graphics hardware turns 6 this year. This is certainly the longest a graphics card has ever lasted for me. 

Like I said on the show, I still don’t feel a direct need to upgrade. I’m still using a 1080p monitor, so games look fine and play fine. But I’m considering an upgrade just for the sake of screenshots. I don’t want people to accuse me of being unfair to a game and making it look bad because I’m running it on a potato. 

But I don’t think the upgrade is go…</itunes:summary>

<strong>00:00 Suddenly done with Anthem</strong></p>
<p>During this segment, Paul references this talk: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg">Juice it or lose it – a talk by Martin Jonasson &amp; Petri Purho</a>. Here is the same idea conveyed with better audio and production values:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>14:45 Still Playing Warframe</strong></p>
<p>As promised on the show, here is the build I’m using in Warframe:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>For those that don’t play: The two rows of stuff that begin with “Stretch” and “Streamline” are slots where you equip various cards that boost your stats. Redirection boosts my shields by 360%. Fast deflection boosts my shield recharge rate by 90%. Vitality gives me 400% more health. Steel Fiber gives me +80% armor. While the game never explains what armor does, players have told me it’s really important. I assume it reduces damage to hitpoints by some amount. How much? I dunno. <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Armor">Go read the wiki</a>, because the game itself won’t tell you.</p>
<p>You can see there are little glowing blue pips on the cards. You can upgrade the cards. The cost to do so goes up exponentially while the bonus scales linearly. So maybe every level of upgrade will add an additional 20% to (some value) but the cost to do so doubles every time.</p>
<p>This is it. This is the best I’ve been able to do in terms of survivability. I’m as durable as I can get. Yes, I can maybe squeeze another level out of a couple of these cards. The cost to raise even one of these cards would be staggering. Literally days of grinding for the endo resource, which is what is used to upgrade these cards. Even if I did that, it’s not like these last couple of upgrades would be all that game-changing. Increasing my shield boost from +360% to +380% isn’t going to change the result all that much.</p>
<p>Like I said on the show, this boss<span class="snote" title="1">The junction guardian going from Pluto to Sedna.</span> killed me instantly, with a single shot, the moment the fight began, using a hitscan weapon. I hit the button to open the door and then fell over dead before I even saw the bad guy move. The boss pulled this trick several times before I scraped by using blind luck and cheese. </p>
<p>There’s no way to tell how much the boss was OVER killing me. I’ll admit that Mag (the warframe I’m using) isn’t the most durable in the game, but she’s not <strong>that</strong> far behind the others in terms of survivability. I could spend a week grinding for more endo to upgrade my cards and find he was still one-shotting me. At the very best, doing the full round of upgrades might allow me to survive a single shot. Maybe switching to the most durable frame I have might let me take two shots. That’s still ridiculous in terms of a fight against an AI with a hitscan weapon in an open arena.</p>
<p>I don’t know. Maybe this is what the designer intended. Maybe I’m not supposed to be going after this content just yet. Maybe there’s some secret mystery card out there that will vastly improve my survivability. The difficulty of this game is all over the place. Nothing in any of the previous missions indicated I was getting in over my head.</p>
<p>This is such a stubbornly obtuse game. </p>
<p>On the other hand, Warframe isn’t boring. Not like that other game. The one that just came out. What was it called again? Anaheim or something?</p>
<p><strong>22:12 Mailbag: Sony’s Handheld Misadventures</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast</p>
<p>With rumours of the Xbox Gamepass coming to the Nintendo Switch should Sony consider re-entering the handheld market?  Is it worth the risk for Sony to build a successor to the PS Vita or consider making the PS5 a hybrid console?  Or would it be better for them to leave the market to Nintendo and Microsoft? </p>
<p>Regards </p>
<p>Eric</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>33:26 Paul’s Peculiar Python Programming Project</strong></p>
<p>Here are <a href="http://peripheralarbor.com/gallery/v/CG+Art/scripts/crystal/">some renders of the crystal structures Paul made</a>.</p>
<p><strong>48:33 Mailbag: Simulationist approach to game design.  </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi!</p>
<p>2/10 stars question.</p>
<p>I got an itch to replay old and very niche games (Brigade E5 and 7.62mm), since there were nothing like them to this day (even close). They are very simulationist hardcore tactical strategies (think X-Com and Jagged Alliance 2 but with real-time with smart pause) that placed realism of all interactions above all else (a small example, getting a clip from a pocket is 2.35 seconds faster than getting a same clip from a backpack; all these rules applies to enemies as well). Of course, it means that these games aren’t really friendly, like recent XCOM games, and it would take a lot of time, patience and quickloads to finish them. So my question is – is there a merit in going against getting fun/balanced/polished gameplay all the way to a practically complete 1-to-1 realism (to expand to other games, think ArmA, SWAT4, Richard Burns Rally, etc)? What would be gained from this, in your eyes, and what would be lost?</p>
<p>Best regards, DeadlyDark</p></blockquote>

<strong>00:00 Shamus stopped playing Warframe</strong></p>
<p>I tried. I checked the wiki. I looked on Youtube. I searched the forums. I didn’t find anything that would let me clear the Pluto junction without having to do the dumb spy mission. Maybe I’ll get the itch to play through that at some point, but I’m shelving the game for now. I’ll probably come back when the <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Wisp_(PH)">Wisp</a> Warframe is released.</p>
<p><strong>19:59 Anthem is Officially out!</strong></p>
<p>I’m having a good time with it for now, but the whole thing is pretty watered down. If the splash screen logo didn’t tell me this was a BioWare game, I never would have guessed it.</p>
<p>I looked on YouTube and I couldn’t find the particular trailer Paul was talking about. (There are a lot of trailers!) The closest thing I could find was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wka5RovFEo8">this thing</a> from Hollywood director Neill Blomkamp (District 9) which is indeed pretty cool, but had absolutely nothing to do with anything that happens or is talked about in the game.</p>
<p><strong>40:22 Mailbag: Technical debt and the case for software sustainers</strong>  </p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>While browsing LinkedIn I happened across <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/renewed-case-software-sustaining-bj-black/">a series of articles which I thought you might find interesting</a>.</p>
<p>The author presents a notion that throughout the development cycle, software is created, sustained for a while, and eventually destroyed and replaced, and that the creation phase leads to the accumulation of what he calls technical debt (e.g. the costs of maintaining the code, fixing bugs, providing customer support etc.).</p>
<p>He then points out that the tech industry tends to put creators (developers) on the pedestal while marginalizing the work done by sustainers and destroyers (QA, DevOps, support etc.), often to the detriment of the final product, as the technical debt becomes overwhelming.</p>
<p>The series has immediately reminded me of Shamus’s writing style, so I’m sending it over on a hunch, in case you guys had any experiences that would go in line with or against the notions presented in the articles, or simply find the subject matter worth discussing.</p>
<p>Lots of love,<br>
Pawe?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>50:13 Mailbag: Nintendo with a more common console?</strong>  </p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast</p>
<p>Nintendo is a very large and very successful company and they are currently doing very well with Switch.  However do you think that if Nintendo had been more conventional, more open to risks and new ideas they could be even more successful than they are today?  </p>
<p>(By conventional I mean less of a gimmicky approach to hardware, better third party support, more first party games in popular genres, more adult orientated games, less draconian views on streaming, etc.)</p>

<p><strong>1:01:49 Mailbag: Andromeda setting.</strong>  </p>
<blockquote><p>Hi!</p>
<p>3 out of 10 question</p>
<p>I’ve started ME Andromeda (can’t just read your series), and while I agree with your assessment of writing, I actually have another gripe with it. Not sure, how legitimate is it, and don’t think I saw anyone bringing it up. May be I’m wrong and just imagined all this? I think the premise of you being a pathfinder, exploring new worlds for colonization in another galaxy, is wrong for the Mass Effect setting. If anything, that promise of finding new planets and exploring them more suited for the Milky Way (which was shown in Mass Effect 1), with mostly closed mass relays.</p>
<p>Andromeda didn’t suffer Reaper cycles (I hope), her civilizations had millennia to advance. Arcs should’ve arrived and find themselves in active gala-political (?) scape, with major powers having tech at least rivaling the Reapers, and minor ones, being lower than Milky Way species. It could’ve been unstable Cold War-like situation, which would become even more unstable with guests from Milky Way.</p>
<p>I know its a fanfic level of writing I’ve just displayed, but it bothers me to no end, that writers didn’t capitalize on main in-setting difference between galaxies. On the other hand, considering the level of writing in Andromeda, may be its for the best, that they decided to take way less ambitious route with the premise.</p>
<p>Best regards, DeadlyDark</p></blockquote>
<p>In this section I mentioned my Andromeda retrospective and talked about “last week’s entry”. Looking at the blog, I now see that the post I was referring to is the one that will go up <strong>tomorrow</strong>. Sorry, this gets confusing for me. For me there’s the post that you’re commenting on, the posts that are about to go live, and the future posts I’m currently writing / proofing. Sometime I lose track of what’s made it to the front page. </p>
<p>Barring any major re-writes, the final Andromeda entry will appear on April 9. After that, I’m thinking about doing a series on programming languages.</p>

50:13 Mailbag: Nintendo with a more common console?  

Dear Diecast
Nintendo is a very large and very successful company and they are currently doing very well with Switch.  However do you think that if Nintendo had been more conventional, more open to risks and new ideas they could be even more successful than they are today?  
(By conventional I mean less of a gimmicky approach to hardware, better third party support, more first party games in popular genres, more adult orientated games, less draconian views on streaming, etc.)

Eric
1:01:49 Mailbag: Andromeda setting.  

Hi!
3 out of 10 question
I’ve started ME Andromeda (can’t just read your series), and while I agree with your assessment of writing, I actually have another gripe with it. Not sure, how legitimate is it, and don’t think I saw anyone bringing it up. May be I’m wrong and just imagined all this? I think the premise of you being a pathfinder, exploring new worlds for colonization in another galaxy, is wrong for the Mass Effect setting. If anything, that promise of finding new planets and exploring them more suited for the Milky Way (which was shown in Mass Effect 1), with mostly closed mass relays.
Andromeda didn’t suffer Reaper cycles (I hope), her civilizations had millennia to advance. Arcs should’ve arrived and find themselves in active gala-political (?) scape, with major powers having tech at least rivaling the Reapers, and minor ones, being lower than Milky Way species. It could’ve been unstable Cold War-like situation, which would become even more unstable with guests from Milky Way.
I know its a fanfic level of writing I’ve just displayed, but it bothers me to no end, that writers didn’t capitalize on main in-setting difference between galaxies. On the other h…</itunes:summary>

48:47 Mailbag: Fan feedback vs. entitlement

Hello members of the council of the Diecast,
In December of last year. The devs of Spider-Man PS4 got into a conversation on Twitter regarding the inclusion of the Raimi suit in the then upcoming DLC. The ensuing conversation was a back and forth between Spider-Man fans who expressed hope and concern about the Raimi suit’s inclusion, and Insomniac supporters who pushed back against what was starting to sound like bitter fan entitlement.
I got into a conversation with a friend about this last week and my perspective is that video games are just like any other product. A company/people/developer etc. is offering you a service, you buy that service and so, it is basic capitalism. Whoever is selling needs to know the wishes of the public and tune their product accordingly. After all, you don’t want your product to be something nobody wants or sells poorly.
Obviously, there are many exceptions to this sort of thinking. Think F2P games or Games which don’t recieve DLC or other content (this is rare nowadays). And there is a difference between ‘asking’ for changes or additions to a game, and demanding them, obviously.
My question is:
How large do you think the role of the consumer should be when it comes to offering feedback or suggesting additions/changes to a video game that they bought before it becomes unreasonable (eg demanding Nintendo put guns and gore in Zelda games).
Sincerely and apologies for the long question,
Lucas

<p>Show notes:<span id="more-45620"></span><br>
<strong>00:00 DeepMind – The learning AI for Starcraft</strong></p>
<p>Since recording this, I’ve watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUTMhmVh1qs">the DeepMind show match between the AI and a couple of pro players</a>. I think I’ll cover this topic in my column next week.</p>
<p><strong>05:27 Chainmail Bikini Will Return</strong></p>
<p>Like I said on the show, I don’t want to back-date them into the archives. At the same time, I don’t want to post them three times a week or they’ll drown out the rest of the content. Having thought about this some more, I think I’ll be posting the comics once a week, on Sundays.</p>
<p><strong>07:30 Paul introduced his kids to Portal</strong></p>
<p>As an aside, here’s a reference to <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/comicsandcosplay/comics/stolen-pixels/8104-Stolen-Pixels-226-Chime-Chime-Chime">the Chime problem I had</a>.</p>
<p><strong>14:51 Anthem First Impressions</strong></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>In the public reception of Anthem, I was hoping for one of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A return to form for BioWare, taking their classic worldbuilding and blending it with modern looter-shooter gameplay.</li>
<li>A buggy disjointed disaster of a game with an embarrassing story and terrible gameplay that punishes the studio for dumping their longtime fans to chase the shooter market.</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead, it looks like we’re getting the least interesting result. From the the first impressions, it sounds like Anthem is competent but ordinary. It will probably carve out a modest chunk of the Destiny / Warframe market and coast along as a perfectly serviceable entry in the genre. (Until EA closes it down in disappointment because it didn’t make a billion dollars.)</p>
<p><strong>22:15 Fallout 76 Multiplayer System</strong></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>I keep promising myself that I’ll stop covering this game because there’s no point in beating a dead horse. But damn it, this dead horse was so smug and entitled that I just can’t resist a few more swings.</p>
<p><strong>30:13 Windows 10 on Old Computers</strong></p>
<p>Paul tried to install Windows 10 on these old machines:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 Refurbished: HP Compaq 6200 Pro SFF PC Dual Core Intel G620 2.6GHz 2GB RAM 250GB HDD</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">2007 Intel Core 2 quad Q6600 @ 2.4 GHz, 4GB ram, a 250GB SSD (new 2014), an optical drive, and a Refurbished: EVGA GeForce GT 630 DirectX 11 02G-P3-2639-RX 2GB 128-Bit DDR3 PCI Express 2.0 x16 graphics card (new 2014)</span></li>
<li>2005 AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual 4200+ at 2.2GHz, 1.37 GB ram (on three sticks), 2x 300GB hard drives, integrated graphics, a special Sound Blaster X-Fi module, and not one but two optical drives!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>43:05 Mailbag: Measuring Story Quality</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi!</p>
<p>With all this recent talk about stories, plot-holes and their impact on the quality of said stories, it got me thinking… So, ok, contrivance’s or plot-hole’s impact is negative on the story. But lets imagine there are two stories of equal length, both without plot-holes (for example, they say Alien and The Thing are both without plot holes, and roughly of equal length). What metrics could be used to measure which story is better? I have few ideas (one of them listed below), but I want to hear your (podcast members) take on it as well</p>
<p>I also has another idea (which is more applicable more to movies, than anything else, I gather). So, there are movies with relatively thin plot, but their strength is in great action scenes, that are enabled by said plot (let’s say, Predator, The Raid or half the Jackie Chan movies). So, when I thought about first question, one of the potential metric that popped up in my head, is the amount and the intensity of conflicts presented in the story per time unit. Individual action scene is the short story on itself, isn’t it? I can show you, say, the plane scene in Octopussy, where Bond (and the stuntman) climbs on top the plane and you’ll get the complete idea what’s happening, what’s in stake and how it will affect Bond if he fails. And good action scene is always about how tense the situation for the hero, and bad ones, outside of bad cinematography, have little danger for the protagonist (as an example, in SPECTRE, Bond shoots bad guys in villain’s lair with so much ease, its boring). So, the popular opinion (I think), is that plot in these movies is weak or not great or not worth mentioning. But I’m starting to think that this is the other way around. If the main story enables the writer to give you such amount of tense and inventive visual mini-stories (Bond on the plane, Bond runs on alligators, Bond climbing the mountain and someone cuts his rope), isn’t it the sign of great storytelling? I’m not sure myself yet, but I think that’s an interesting idea to explore.</p>
<p>Best regards, DeadlyDark</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>56:26 Mailbag: 7/10 Scores</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast</p>
<p>I have noticed a trend of inflation when it comes to game review scores.  These days even a review score of 7/10 is considered rather poor.  What do you think is the cause of this and do you think there is a way to fix this?</p>

Show notes:
00:00 DeepMind – The learning AI for Starcraft

Since recording this, I’ve watched the DeepMind show match between the AI and a couple of pro players. I think I’ll cover this topic in my column next week.

05:27 Chainmail Bikini Will Return

Like I said on the show, I don’t want to back-date them into the archives. At the same time, I don’t want to post them three times a week or they’ll drown out the rest of the content. Having thought about this some more, I think I’ll be posting the comics once a week, on Sundays.

07:30 Paul introduced his kids to Portal

As an aside, here’s a reference to the Chime problem I had.

14:51 Anthem First Impressions




In the public reception of Anthem, I was hoping for one of two things:


A return to form for BioWare, taking their classic worldbuilding and blending it with modern looter-shooter gameplay.
A buggy disjointed disaster of a game with an embarrassing story and terrible gameplay that punishes the studio for dumping their longtime fans to chase the shooter market.

Instead, it looks like we’re getting the least interesting result. From the the first impressions, it sounds like Anthem is competent but ordinary. It will probably carve out a modest chunk of the Destiny / Warframe market and coast along as a perfectly serviceable entry in the genre. (Until EA closes it down in disappointment because it didn’t make a billion dollars.)

22:15 Fallout 76 Multiplayer System




I keep promising myself that I’ll stop covering this game because there’s no point in beating a dead horse. But damn it, this dead horse was so smug and entitled that I just can’t resist a few more swings.

30:13 Windows 10 on Old Computers

Paul tried to install Windows 10 on these old machines:


2017 Refurbished: HP Compaq 6200 Pro SFF PC Dual Core Intel G620 2.6GHz 2GB RAM 250GB HDD
2007 Intel Core 2 quad Q6600 @ 2.4 GHz, 4GB ram, a 250GB SSD (new 2014), an optical drive, and a Refurbished: EVGA GeForce GT 630 DirectX 11 02G-P3-2639-RX 2GB 128-Bit DDR3 PCI Express 2.0 x16 graphics card (new 2014)
2005 AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual 4200+ at 2.2GHz, 1.37 GB ram (on three sticks), 2x 300GB hard drives, integrated graphics, a special Sound Blaster X-Fi module, and not one but two optical drives!

43:05 Mailbag: Measuring Story Quality

Hi!
With all this recent talk about stories, plot-holes and their impact on the quality of said stories, it got me thinking… So, ok, contrivance’s or plot-hole’s impact is negative on the story. But lets imagine there are two stories of equal length, both without plot-holes (for example, they say Alien and The Thing are both without plot holes, and roughly of equal length). What metrics could be used to measure which story is better? I have few ideas (one of them listed below), but I want to hear your (podcast members) take on it as well
I also has another idea (which is more applicable more to movies, than anything else, I gather). So, there are movies with relatively thin plot, but their strength is in great action scenes, that are enabled by said plot (let’s say, Predator, The Raid or half the Jackie Chan movies). So, when I thought about first question, one of the potential metric that popped up in my head, is the amount and the intensity of conflicts presented in the story per time unit. Individual action scene is the short story on itself, isn’t it? I can show you, say, the plane scene in Octopussy, where Bond (and the stuntman) climbs on top the plane and you’ll get the complete idea what’s happening, what’s in stake and how it will affect Bond if he fails. And good action scene is always about how tense the situation for the hero, and bad ones, outside of bad cinematography, have little danger for the protagonist (as an example, in SPECTRE, Bond shoots bad guys in villain’s lair with so much ease, its boring). So, the popular opinion (I think), is that plot in these movies is weak or not great or not worth menti…</itunes:summary>

<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast.</p>
<p>You most likely already have read the news about Ubisoft moving their games from Steam to Epic store. Shamus seems pretty positive about Epic store because of “competition is always good”. But for me it looks like rather bad thing happening right now to PC gaming. Epic doesn’t compete with Steam for customers, it competes for developers, and the customers are just getting screwed in the process, because they are forced to use obviously inferior (in terms of features) store. No reviews, no forums, no tags, no big picture, no controller customization, no time played tracking and so on. Steam developed shitton of features over the years which it didn’t have to (because of having no competitors). Why would you think that Epic would do the same? They have the games exclusively on their store and it’s enough to force the customer that want to play them to use it. Epic haven’t promised any features other than user reviews (opt in for publisher!). Origin and Uplay exist for years and they have zero of Steam features. Isn’t it likely that we end up with Epic store as the same shitty but cross-publisher store? For me it looks more about corporate greed than any consumer benefits. Epic has billions of profits from Fortnite which they want to invest in getting cut from every pc game sale, and publishers want to have bigger share of revenue. Customers are just would be forced to live with what corporations allow them.</p>
<p>Best regards, Dmitri.</p></blockquote>
<p>I notice we keep having this discussion, and I’m not sure how to break us out of this loop. Let me try an analogy:</p>
<p>A sports team comes up with a new strategy. Say the Zanarkand Abes invent a new passing strategy. Suddenly they begin scoring goals in situations where teams usually couldn’t score. This is a good strategy. It makes the game more interesting. This strategy might be adopted by other teams and mix things up.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the Zanarkand Abes are the best team, or even that they deserve to win the title. They might be a terrible team with bad players, but this move they invented still has value. In a league where one team wins all the time, anything that disrupts the status quo is good.</p>
<p>Yes, the Epic platform might ruin a few titles. Maybe it will turn out the platform never adds basic features. But that still could be less overall damage to the industry than having everything ruled by a single hegemonic storefront. Consider two numbers:</p>
<p>A: The number of titles that would have made money if they were only paying a 12% royalty fee, but who lost money with a 30% royalty fee. These teams will either disband or choose not to make a sequel.</p>
<p>B: The number of games that wind up being exclusive to the Epic games store.</p>
<p>If A is greater than B, then Epic’s move is overall good for games <strong>even if they never improve their storefront</strong>. On top of this, I think a game being tied to a single horrible storefront is less of a tragedy than a game not getting made at all. This is particularly true in the case of under-served markets and niche games.</p>
<p>That said, I’m actually pinning my hopes on Discord and GoG.</p>

<p>It’s a spoiler discussion, so if you’re not into that then jump to…</p>
<p><strong>24:17 Activision lost their CFO this week. Twice.</strong></p>
<p>First <a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/netflix-spencer-neumann-cfo-1203097647/amp/">they lost Spencer Neumann to Netflix</a>, and a few days later <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tn-square-amrita-ahuja-20190103-story.html?outputType=amp">they lost Amrita Ahuja to Square</a>.</p>
<p><strong>33:20 Who has time to talk about: Fallout 76 Multiplayer system?</strong></p>
<p>The first step in fixing a problem is admitting you have one.</p>
<p><strong>33:38 Mailbag: Microsoft game Engine</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>So, I had this crazy idea and I’m curious to see what you’d think of it.</p>
<p>If Microsoft is seriously looking at moving into gaming as a cross-platform thing, it occurs to me that one big step they could make would be to create their own game engine for the use of the developers they’re acquiring, and also to license out to other developers.  I mean, from what I understand that could be a BIG move for them that would have a HUGE impact on the industry.  I’ve heard it said that Microsoft is amazing at designing tools for software developers, and that would really leverage their “core competency” and put them in a position to have much broader effects on the games industry than they would just by buying games developers and selling gaming systems.</p>
<p>What do you guys think?</p>

<p><strong>39:16 Mailbag: Games that miss the mark.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>When it comes to games that miss the mark, what is the worst or most painful combination in your eyes?  A game with an excellent story/characters/writing but bad mechanics/gameplay, or a game with excellent mechanics/gameplay and a bad story/characters/writing?  Of those two, which would be more disappointing to you?</p>
<p>And on the same note, are there any exceptions to your answer that you can think of out of the games you’ve played in the past, where that element was strong enough that it kept you interested to the end (and maybe even happy) despite its flaws?</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Marcus Virgil</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>46:15 Mailbag: Dragon Age Inquisition</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi!</p>
<p>I’m playing Dragon Age Inquisition right now, and one thing that bothers me a lot (besides one sidequest bug) is that we are playing as the head of organization are running around doing stuff expanding influence, claiming land and gaining favors (I’m doing everything there, because I just can’t left things; I know I have a problem). But our opposing force (cultists + Coripheus) aren’t as proactive. We are stopping their plan in the region, and that’s it, no retaliation (unless you go and do main plot, I suspect). It feels like chess is played only by me, and the opponent is skipping his turns.  That aspect should’ve been done not via standard rpg questing in huge maps with copy-paste side content and such, but via some kind of strategy level management (a-la expanded X-Com or simplified Civilization or Crusader Kings; I think King Arthur games combined story driven rpg with strategy), with occasional mission only for Inquisitor. That would change the genre, but would fit the story way more (not that story is bad, actually I’m surprised that its better than I expected). Older games didn’t have that disconnect. In KOTOR / Mass Effect you’re basically small infiltration team and your gains are intelligence and nothing more. In DAO you’re opposing mindless force, so it makes sense that it isn’t that proactive (and even then it was shown expanding its territory).</p>
<p>Have you noticed that? Do you think that genre change would’ve make DAI better? Any other commentary on this?</p>
<p>Best regards, DeadlyDark</p></blockquote>

      <itunes:summary>Happy 2019! We start off the year with positivity and praise. It lasts almost half an hour before we spiral back into complaining and snark. We tried.

Show notes: 
00:00 Into the Spider-Verse

It’s a spoiler discussion, so if you’re not into that then jump to…

24:17 Activision lost their CFO this week. Twice.

First they lost Spencer Neumann to Netflix, and a few days later they lost Amrita Ahuja to Square.

33:20 Who has time to talk about: Fallout 76 Multiplayer system?

The first step in fixing a problem is admitting you have one.

33:38 Mailbag: Microsoft game Engine

So, I had this crazy idea and I’m curious to see what you’d think of it.
If Microsoft is seriously looking at moving into gaming as a cross-platform thing, it occurs to me that one big step they could make would be to create their own game engine for the use of the developers they’re acquiring, and also to license out to other developers.  I mean, from what I understand that could be a BIG move for them that would have a HUGE impact on the industry.  I’ve heard it said that Microsoft is amazing at designing tools for software developers, and that would really leverage their “core competency” and put them in a position to have much broader effects on the games industry than they would just by buying games developers and selling gaming systems.
What do you guys think?

39:16 Mailbag: Games that miss the mark.

Dear Diecast,
When it comes to games that miss the mark, what is the worst or most painful combination in your eyes?  A game with an excellent story/characters/writing but bad mechanics/gameplay, or a game with excellent mechanics/gameplay and a bad story/characters/writing?  Of those two, which would be more disappointing to you?
And on the same note, are there any exceptions to your answer that you can think of out of the games you’ve played in the past, where that element was strong enough that it kept you interested to the end (and maybe even happy) despite its flaws?
Best,
Marcus Virgil
46:15 Mailbag: Dragon Age Inquisition

Hi!
I’m playing Dragon Age Inquisition right now, and one thing that bothers me a lot (besides one sidequest bug) is that we are playing as the head of organization are running around doing stuff expanding influence, claiming land and gaining favors (I’m doing everything there, because I just can’t left things; I know I have a problem). But our opposing force (cultists + Coripheus) aren’t as proactive. We are stopping their plan in the region, and that’s it, no retaliation (unless you go and do main plot, I suspect). It feels like chess is played only by me, and the opponent is skipping his turns.  That aspect should’ve been done not via standard rpg questing in huge maps with copy-paste side content and such, but via some kind of strategy level management (a-la expanded X-Com or simplified Civilization or Crusader Kings; I think King Arthur games combined story driven rpg with strategy), with occasional mission only for Inquisitor. That would change the genre, but would fit the story way more (not that story is bad, actually I’m surprised that its better than I expected). Older games didn’t have that disconnect. In KOTOR / Mass Effect you’re basically small infiltration team and your gains are intelligence and nothing more. In DAO you’re opposing mindless force, so it makes sense that it isn’t that proactive (and even then it was shown expanding its territory).
Have you noticed that? Do you think that genre change would’ve make DAI better? Any other commentary on this?
Best regards, DeadlyDark

<p><strong>1:13:18 Mailbag: Best project of 2018?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi!</p>
<p>End of the year question for podcast. So, out of all the things you published/done this year, which makes you proud the most? And the least?</p>
<p>Best regards, DeadlyDark</p></blockquote>
<p>Allow me to take this opportunity to <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?page_id=45100">plug my book</a>. Also, I created a static page for my book <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?page_id=45100">here on the blog</a>. Every post or page is given a unique ID. You can see it in the URL. This post has an ID of 45232, which is why you see /?p=45232 at the end of the URL. By random chance, the page for my book wound up with the ID of 45100. This is the first code given to the player in System Shock 2, and serves as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAtAyycx-uY">451 callback</a> for the game. I began my transition to writing with my first book, which was a novelization of the first System Shock game.</p>
<p>So by random chance the ID of the page of my latest book matches the door code in the videogame sequel to the game that inspired me to become a writer in the first place. I realize this is just a very minor coincidence, but every time I see that 45100 at the top my brain starts screaming at me that ALL OF THIS MEANS SOMETHING.</p>
<p>If it does mean anything, it probably means I need to get out more.</p>
<p><strong>1:18:16 Mailbag: Unity Dev Series</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear uncle Shamus,</p>
<p>I have recently come upon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMakingOfGames/comments/34qogp/return_of_the_obra_dinn_development_blog_updates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this reddit thread</span></a> with links to Lucas Pope’s updates on developing Obra Dinn and wrestling with Unity to bring his vision to life.</p>
<p>They are not terribly in depth, but I figured you would find them interesting regardless.</p>
<p>Wasting your time from Italy,<br>
Steven</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s it for 2018, everyone. Be safe. See you next year.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear diecast,</p>
<p>I just saw online that heroes of the storm is going to be losing some manpower and financing. (https://www.techspot.com/amp/news/77875-blizzard-shifts-top-developers-away-heroes-storm-halts.html), since you’re going to record a diecast tomorrow I wonder if you can pick this up in your  podcast. I always liked of blizzard that they supported their games for way longer than most companies would. So seeing them give up on HOTS is kinda sad and makes me fear they really got tainted bad by their activision side. Now the official news is that its just lowering the amount of content being put out, but it feels like manager speak for “yeah we gave up on it”.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We cover the second half of this email in the next section…</p>
<p><strong>30:37 Mailbag: Starcraft</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Also since I’m writing anyway, this isn’t really directly for the diecast, but more of a personal question. I remember you mention playing SC2 again. Reading your older article on the story side of things (and how you thought it wasnt as bad as fans said it was) I was wondering how well you remembered the first game. To me SC1 and SC2 feel like mass effect 1 and ME2. The writer not understanding the tone of the original. Like kerrigan suddenly being a good guy trapped inside an evil shell. Even though in the brood war it basically was stated outright she was fully in control and was truly evil. I could write a whole page on the issues i have with the story and tone, but I won’t spill unnecessary ink.</p>
<p>with kind regards,<br>

<p><strong>42:40 Mailbag: Netflix getting into gaming? </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,<br>
I recently discovered that Netflix has a stripped-down version of Minecraft: Story Mode available to play, at least on the computer version of the platform. Though they’ve removed all the QTE sequences and most of the inconsequential dialogue choices, they still let the player make all the major decisions in the story.<br>
My question is how should we interpret this foray into gaming by Netflix? Is this a one time thing? Are they just planning on making their own story games? Something more? I’d love to know what you think. I’m personally hoping for a Spirit or She-Ra adventure game soon. </p>
<p>Best Wishes,<br>
Allie</p></blockquote>
<p>After recording this episode, I checked out Minecraft Story Mode on Netflix. It is indeed a “choose your own adventure” kind of deal. You play it as if it was a movie, but sometimes you’ll get prompts to make branching decisions. I’m reasonably sure this works like the old laserdisc “games” built around the same idea.</p>
<p>Also, I have to say the writing was incredibly bland. In the first 15 minutes it was a bulk exposition dump, followed by some stilted dialog between two people with no conflict or stakes. No jokes, no witty observations about Minecraft, no questions to make the audience curious. It wasn’t bad in the sense of being idiotic, it just didn’t offer your brain anything to engage with. </p>
<p>What I’m saying is, I can see why Telltale folded. </p>

      <itunes:summary>Look at the date! We are quickly running out of year. And now that I’m thinking about it, we’re also kinda running out of decade. But as luck would have it, we’ve got plenty of week left. So let’s squander some time talking about videogames.

Show notes:

00:00 The Outer Worlds

I know we watched it last week, but it wouldn’t hurt to watch it again.




04:41 Gris

I know you JUST watched a trailer, but you should watch this one too.




13:30 The Other Kind of Life book launch!

Obligatory: You can get the Kindle version of The Other Kind of Life, or if you really have it in for trees you can buy the print version.

17:36 Dynamo




25:06 Mailbag: HOTS shutting down

Dear diecast,
I just saw online that heroes of the storm is going to be losing some manpower and financing. (https://www.techspot.com/amp/news/77875-blizzard-shifts-top-developers-away-heroes-storm-halts.html), since you’re going to record a diecast tomorrow I wonder if you can pick this up in your  podcast. I always liked of blizzard that they supported their games for way longer than most companies would. So seeing them give up on HOTS is kinda sad and makes me fear they really got tainted bad by their activision side. Now the official news is that its just lowering the amount of content being put out, but it feels like manager speak for “yeah we gave up on it”.

We cover the second half of this email in the next section…

30:37 Mailbag: Starcraft

Also since I’m writing anyway, this isn’t really directly for the diecast, but more of a personal question. I remember you mention playing SC2 again. Reading your older article on the story side of things (and how you thought it wasnt as bad as fans said it was) I was wondering how well you remembered the first game. To me SC1 and SC2 feel like mass effect 1 and ME2. The writer not understanding the tone of the original. Like kerrigan suddenly being a good guy trapped inside an evil shell. Even though in the brood war it basically was stated outright she was fully in control and was truly evil. I could write a whole page on the issues i have with the story and tone, but I won’t spill unnecessary ink.
with kind regards,
chris
42:40 Mailbag: Netflix getting into gaming? 

Dear Diecast,
I recently discovered that Netflix has a stripped-down version of Minecraft: Story Mode available to play, at least on the computer version of the platform. Though they’ve removed all the QTE sequences and most of the inconsequential dialogue choices, they still let the player make all the major decisions in the story.
My question is how should we interpret this foray into gaming by Netflix? Is this a one time thing? Are they just planning on making their own story games? Something more? I’d love to know what you think. I’m personally hoping for a Spirit or She-Ra adventure game soon. 
Best Wishes,
Allie
After recording this episode, I checked out Minecraft Story Mode on Netflix. It is indeed a “choose your own adventure” kind of deal. You play it as if it was a movie, but sometimes you’ll get prompts to make branching decisions. I’m reasonably sure this works like the old laserdisc “games” built around the same idea.

Also, I have to say the writing was incredibly bland. In the first 15 minutes it was a bulk exposition dump, followed by some stilted dialog between two people with no conflict or stakes. No jokes, no witty observations about Minecraft, no questions to make the audience curious. It wasn’t bad in the sense of being idiotic, it just didn’t offer your brain anything to engage with. 

What I’m saying is, I can see why Telltale folded. 

47:46 Epic Megagames: new storefront!

Spoiler: This is basically what I’m going to say in my Escapist column later this week.

57:40 Artifact

		<p>For whatever reason, my audio is blown out in this episode. I have no idea why. I checked it on my end before we started recording and the levels looked good. This happened a couple of weeks ago and I’m not sure where this is going wrong. It’s amazing that I’ve made 235 of these silly things and I’m still running into new ways that things can fall apart.</p>
<p>I should add that I have my audio going into my headphones and it sounds just fine. The levels coming from the microphone looked reasonable. But somewhere between the microphone and the final recording is a bit of software that’s decided to “help” me a little too much. I was forcibly updated to a new version of Windows a couple of weeks ago. That update is my first suspect, if only because that’s the only thing to have changed recently. I did find a volume slider set to 100%<span class="snote" title="1">I seem to recall that the slider in Windows audio settings use the convention that 50% is full volume and everything above that is software boosting.

<p>My voice really is terrible in this one. Sorry. I’d scrap the whole thing, but this episode is a chat with SoldierHawke and we don’t get those very often.</p>
<p>To compensate for this bad sound, I suggest listening to the show in a noisy old car with blown out speakers while driving very fast on a busy highway with the windows down while a truck shadows your blind spot. That should fully mask the audio problems by hiding it under many other audio problems. Also, the constant danger will probably make the show more exciting. Good luck!</p>

<p>Like I said in the show, I’m very curious what other Half-Life 2 fans thought of this game.</p>
<p><strong>16:54 Borderlands 3 No-Show</strong></p>
<p>The longer we go without any sort of announcement, the more I’m afraid this project has gotten away from them and turned into a bloated unfocused mess. Issac (the editor on this show) is a huge <em>Borderlands 2</em> fan and every week for the last year we’ve had the “Any Borderlands 3 news yet?” conversation. </p>
<p><strong>24:23 The Outer Worlds</strong></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>I’m really sorry I dumped on the looks of this game during this segment. To be clear, those comments were based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3cRpYGVPsU">this game informer preview</a> and <strong>not</strong> the trailer. Also, that footage is still pre-release. </p>
<p>Overall, the game is really attractive. Sure, the lip sync is occasionally janky and the faces occupy that weird spot alongside <em>Mass Effect Andromeda</em> where you can’t always tell if it’s supposed to be stylized or not. But this shouldn’t be a problem. Facial animation is not as important as good writing, detailed worldbuilding, solid pacing, consistent characterization, engaging dialog, coherent direction and clear presentation. Going by the trailer, this game has it where it counts.</p>
<p>But for whatever reason, the gaming press is always really hard on Obsidian about their visuals. Bethesda puts out a game with stiff, potato-faced mannequins and shit writing and the world drowns them in awards. Then Obsidian comes in and uses the exact same engine and art assets to make a game that’s ten times smarter and everyone sneers at them for the crappy visuals. </p>
<p>Which is to say: I’m not really faulting the visuals in this game, I’m just worrying that the visuals will harm the game in terms of critical reception. </p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>I have read Shamus’ columns regarding the EA, lootboxes, marketing and the state of the gaming industry in general.  I found his takes to be collected and insightful in an realm that I think is often fraught with misunderstanding.  What I would like to ask the diecast is whether they have paid much attention to Paradox Interactive games and their policy of neverending DLC.  </p>
<p>As you likely know, Paradox publishes and develops Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis, Stellaris, and Hearts of Iron.  As a simple example of their business policy, look at Crusader Kings II.  CK2 was released in 2012 and as of this writing has just short of $300 worth of DLC and a new large expansion is planned to be release this coming week, nearly seven years since its original release.  This seems like it creates a weird situation for buyers; if you’re buying the game today, you’re not going to want to buy all the DLC and you might feel like you’re being cheated having all these features locked behind paywalls (about half the characters are unplayable without two of the DLCs).  That said, I bought CK2 at release and really enjoyed it and playing the game today without DLC is really a more expansive game than it was at release.</p>
<p>A cynic could say that Paradox should have released a “finished” game back in 2012, but I personally am always satisfied with their updates and am happy to pay for them to keep them coming (for CK2 and Stellaris, anyway).  What’s your take on all this?  Are there some perspectives I’m missing?</p>

<p>Amazingly enough, this demo showcases elements similar to No Man’s Sky, except it’s running at 60 FPS on a PS2 and was made 2001.

<p>Now for my questions: </p>
<p>What do you think of the demo in comparison to No Man’s Sky knowing the hardware they’re each running on?</p>
<p>With this technical achievement in mind, do you think the industry has moved on from letting coding wizards optimize games to the very limit of consoles due to the increased demand of content and the reality of making games at modern graphical fidelity? And if so, what do you think could be done with modern hardware given enough time?</p>
<p>Cheers, and sorry for bringing up No Man’s Sky again. Consider it an out of season April Fools joke.</p>

08:37 Wreck-it-Ralph 2: Ralph Breaks the Internet

Why is this movie called “Ralph Breaks the Internet” instead of “Ralph Wrecks the Internet”? The current title is just a re-hash of an old meme, while the latter references the old meme while connecting it to our lead character.

26:36 Mailbag: The New King of PC Gaming?  

Hello Diecast!
Activision Blizzard has fallen out of favor. Activision are encroaching ever more on Blizzard’s territory with demands on revenue, use of their platform(s), and new, more lucrative business strategies. Eurogamer cites a concern within Blizzard about Activision relationship. We can draw only one conclusion: the king of PC-gaming has fallen.
Who will take up the mantle? Who is the new king of PC-gaming?
Best regards,
Moss

Hi Shamus.
I’m a little surprised with your plans of tackling the Last Jedi movie. But in this light, I’m more interested in seeing you writing about the biggest blockbuster of them all. The Avatar. Would you be interested in doing it?

<p>I’m not going to be one of the “they shouldn’t have made this game” people, but I will say that didn’t anybody in a marketing position realize how this would go over? Did they just not KNOW that there’s a lot of overlap between “willing to go to Blizzcon” and “holds phone games in contempt”? I’m hoping this won’t turn out like Dungeon Keeper Mobile or Command &amp; Conquer Rivals, because Activision isn’t as bad as Electronic Arts, but they’re still pretty bad, and phone games have a reputation for being bad, cash grabby, and frequently both, to the point that it’s newsworthy when a mobile game that gets popular isn’t sucking ass and money at the same time.</p>
<p>In short, do you think if anybody in a position of power actually knew anything about the culture, would the announcement of this have been a quiet aside instead of a major deal?</p>

		<p>Here we spend half the show talking about Halloween, everyone’s favorite blend of stranger danger, cosplay, and diabetes! I know a lot of American culture leaks out into the rest of the world, but I don’t know if that includes Halloween. How widespread is the practice of dressing up in costume and begging around the neighborhood for candy?</p>

<p><strong>01:43 Halloween vs. Christmas</strong></p>
<p>The observation we make here is that Halloween is growing in cultural significance while Christmas is shrinking. Like I said on the show, we’re deliberately avoiding the possible religious dimension to this. Having said that, maybe I’m off base here. Maybe it only seems like Christmas is diminishing. I only have my personal experience to go on. I’m curious if others have noticed a similar trend. </p>
<p>Like I said on the show, I can’t really eat candy because I can’t eat corn and ALL candy in the US is made with corn syrup. Except, a couple of weeks ago we found candy corn made with cane sugar instead of corn syrup. Yes, the one candy that contains no corn is candy corn. </p>
<p>Also, here are a couple of examples on my favorite gag costume:</p>

<p>I’m considering creating a Discord channel for Patreon backers.</p>
<p>On one hand, I want all my content available to everyone for free. Content that’s behind a paywall is content that, essentially, doesn’t exist. If Google can’t find it and if you can’t share it with your friends, then it’s like the content isn’t really on the internet. </p>
<p>On the OTHER hand, I’d like to give some sort of special content to thank people for supporting me. I’m grateful for my supporters and I’m always keen to show my appreciation beyond typing the word “Thanks!” once in a while.</p>
<p>These are two contradictory goals and I’ve never been able to figure out how to reconcile them. I want to reward supporters, but I don’t want that reward to feel like paywalled content. If someone isn’t supporting me financially, I don’t want them to feel like I’m trying to punish them. </p>
<p>From seeing what other creators are doing, it seems like previews are the way to go. Maybe streams, chat channels, and little updates for “here is how far I am into writing project X” or “here is the next game I plan to cover”. Discord seems like a good fit for this.</p>
<p>On the other hand… I dunno. Feel free to share your thoughts on any of this. If you support other creators or hang out in Discord groups, I’d love to hear your views on what works and what annoys you.</p>
<p>For the curious, during this segment I mention <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWQSPDWeLLw">Screen Rant Pitch meeting</a>, which is pretty fun and worth checking out.</p>

      <itunes:summary>Here we spend half the show talking about Halloween, everyone’s favorite blend of stranger danger, cosplay, and diabetes! I know a lot of American culture leaks out into the rest of the world, but I don’t know if that includes Halloween. How widespread is the practice of dressing up in costume and begging around the neighborhood for candy?

<strong>02:06 The Social Network.</strong> </p>
<p>Yes, I’m talking about an 8 year old movie. I’m sure you’ve been waiting all these years to hear my scattershot, non-committal take.</p>

<p><strong>24:37 Mailbag: Windows 10 S</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hey guys.</p>
<p>I recently discovered the existence of Windows 10 S, which is apparently Microsoft’s response to the success of Chrome OS and Chromebooks.  Did you know about this?  It’s supposed to be faster, simpler, and more secure than regular Windows 10, but there are a few supposed features that make me think that it just might be Shamus’ nightmare come to life.  In order of increasing horribleness, they are:</p>
<p>(1) you can upgrade to Windows 10 proper . . . if you fork over an extra $50,</p>

Usually though, games feel structurally akin to a detective novel: most of the runtime has been building towards the ending in some way and if the conclusion to your locked-room murder mystery is “A wizard did it” then the whole thing was a waste of time.</p>

<p>I noticed (that’s no fault of yours or criticism, just an observation, I want to apologize in advance for any potential misunderstanding), that you mostly write about AAA games.

Also, I’m interested to think what people think of the pricing for Early Access games. Sometimes the developer starts high when the game is unfinished and lowers it at release, and sometimes they do the opposite. Both have advantages and disadvantages that I find fascinating.

37:12 Mailbag: Manhattan and other cities in games

Dear diecast,
Many game have included the island of Manhattan in New York as a game world due to it being iconic while at the same time easily isolated for a game world yet at the same time a metropolitan area is developed for residents not gameplay. If you were to be doing an open world based on New York how would you attempt to do it?

		<p>Lots of complaining about personal problems in this episode. I don’t want to pin the blame on anyone in particular, but I will say that Paul never made any effort to stop me.</p>
<p>For those of you who have been complaining the the podcast RSS doesn’t work, can you give <a href="http://random.davidlynch.org/feed2pod/feeds/feed-httpshamusyoung.comtwentysidedtalefeedrss2cat287.xml">this one</a> a try and see if it works for you?

<p><strong>00:00 Moving Sucks&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The swivel arm for my microphone broke this week, which means I needed to have the microphone quite a bit further from my face than I usually do. You’ll probably be able to hear the difference. Over the last few weeks one of the most common phrases around the house has been “We’ll have to fix / replace that once we’re done moving.” This is yet another instance of something that isn’t going to get fixed until after we move.</p>
<p><strong>17:20 Distance</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Shamus, and Paul,</p>
<p>Have you looked into Distance, the pretty neon laser puzzle racer again, it had a full release recently? Can you please write some articles about it, from the POV of a confused rally pilot that somehow got into that universe (eventually, I know you’ll be pretty busy for a while). I know you have the humor chops to make it highly entertaining!</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>
Galad_t</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>28:07 Corporate Leadership</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast (Mostly Shamus but Paul can answer too)</p>
<p>In your last couple of “This Dumb Industry” and “Experienced Points” you have talked about how publishers being run by business people is one of the big problems with the industry.  What reasonable solutions do you have to fixing this problem other than putting Shamus in charge.</p>
<p>Regards Eric </p></blockquote>
<p>A point I wanted to make on the show before I got distracted: It’s really hard for a company to break out of rut. Even if the top leadership resigns, their replacements will come from (or by chosen by) the rest of the existing leadership. The people in charge of finding someone to solve the problem are the same people who have already failed to solve the problem. If you stack your ranks with people who think about increasing profits in terms of microtransactions, then that thinking is going to remain long after you leave. The new guy might experiment with new kinds of monetization, but he’s not going to perform a radical change in course and change the way projects are chosen, funded, managed, and marketed. If he he thought those things were a good idea in the past, then he wouldn’t be in line for the throne now.

      <itunes:summary>Lots of complaining about personal problems in this episode. I don’t want to pin the blame on anyone in particular, but I will say that Paul never made any effort to stop me.

For those of you who have been complaining the the podcast RSS doesn’t work, can you give this one a try and see if it works for you? It’s maintained by a listener, and hopefully isn’t afflicted by whatever curse plagues the RSS that WordPress is generating.

Show notes: 

00:00 Moving Sucks  

The swivel arm for my microphone broke this week, which means I needed to have the microphone quite a bit further from my face than I usually do. You’ll probably be able to hear the difference. Over the last few weeks one of the most common phrases around the house has been “We’ll have to fix / replace that once we’re done moving.” This is yet another instance of something that isn’t going to get fixed until after we move.

17:20 Distance

Hi Shamus, and Paul,
Have you looked into Distance, the pretty neon laser puzzle racer again, it had a full release recently? Can you please write some articles about it, from the POV of a confused rally pilot that somehow got into that universe (eventually, I know you’ll be pretty busy for a while). I know you have the humor chops to make it highly entertaining!
Kind regards,
Galad_t
28:07 Corporate Leadership

Dear Diecast (Mostly Shamus but Paul can answer too)
In your last couple of “This Dumb Industry” and “Experienced Points” you have talked about how publishers being run by business people is one of the big problems with the industry.  What reasonable solutions do you have to fixing this problem other than putting Shamus in charge.
Regards Eric 
A point I wanted to make on the show before I got distracted: It’s really hard for a company to break out of rut. Even if the top leadership resigns, their replacements will come from (or by chosen by) the rest of the existing leadership. The people in charge of finding someone to solve the problem are the same people who have already failed to solve the problem. If you stack your ranks with people who think about increasing profits in terms of microtransactions, then that thinking is going to remain long after you leave. The new guy might experiment with new kinds of monetization, but he’s not going to perform a radical change in course and change the way projects are chosen, funded, managed, and marketed. If he he thought those things were a good idea in the past, then he wouldn’t be in line for the throne now. He would have been edged out or passed over for promotion in favor of someone more in tune with established company values.

Here is the Super Mario 64 challenge I mentioned, where someone tries to play Mario 64 without using the jump button.

<p>Personally fast travel systems often annoy the hell out of me. In the first instance it’s because they are usually immersion breaking. Go to the map and click on the city you want to go to etc with no accounting of the passage of time and effort that requires from your character.

<p>But that’s all just jarring, where it becomes infuriating is when it encourages lazyness in the game devs. Skyrim is a good example of this. Stupid side missions like “kill the rats in my basement” will often times have said basement on the complete opposite side of the map from the mission giver. As if the devs knew the player had fast travel and so location doesn’t matter and so where that basement is on the map is irrelevant. Which may also explain why the map in Skyrim was bordering on unusable.</p>
<p>On the flip side of that in some games the travel itself is a joy and I’ve had great success in having a personal rule of no fast travel. Farcry 3/4 for example, time spent getting around in jeeps and hang gliders is some my favorite gameplay time.</p>

35:30 Young People and Bad Business Practices

Hello blue da ba dee da ba Diecast!
Last week I turned 30, which made me realize something. (Other than not being 29 anymore.)
By gamer standards I’m pretty old.
In a hobby where one could be considered a “hardcore” participant at the age of 8, 10 or 16, 30 seems like
a rather experienced age.
This got me thinking about my absolute disdain towards monetization in todays games.
DLC, Season Passes, more homogenized designs and of course loot boxes.
I’ve heard a lot of gamers excusing and defending these practices as no big deal and accusing it’s detractors of being selfish, entitled and unreasonable. 
I wonder if the majority of these gamers are too young to have grown up with games where your customisation options weren’t locked behind random chance, the grindy parts weren’t tied to a games profits through ingame currency and very important-to-the-story characters weren’t sold as seperate (looking at you Javik from Mass Effect 3).   
Basically my question is,
Do you think a gamers age can be linked to their tolerance for shitty business practices, since that’s what they grew up with?
Thanks for reading, and keep up the great show!
48:21 Photorealism  

Dear Diecastians,
Recently I’ve been playing some Ubisoft games, to include Assassin’s Creed and Ghost Recon. I find the photorealistic environment detail in these games to be incredibly distracting!  
But it got me to wondering:  How are these environments created? Are they  somehow computer-generated via giant art asset libraries? Or do they run environmental artist sweatshops? 
I’m really hoping it’s the former and not the later. What are your thoughts on this and do you find it as distracting as I do?

The answer to both of these is that I haven’t played them, I am interested in them, but I don’t have time for either one.

      <itunes:summary>Soldierhawk is back, and we have lots of games to discuss. One of them is even less than 6 years old, because this site is dedicated to bringing you timely and relevant games criticism and positivity!


Hosts: Soldierhawk, Shamus. Episode edited by Issac.

Show notes:
00:05 A Sad, awkward take about the number 224.

This story takes place at Seven Springs, but it isn’t nearly as cool or fun as my visit to Seven Springs the following year.

04:55 Spec Ops: The Line

You might remember that I just read a book that talked about the making of this game.

20:49 Dark Souls

I mentioned Joseph Anderson in this section. Here is an example of one of his videos:




And here is the recent 3-hour video on God of War I mentioned. While I can’t say for sure, I’m reasonably sure this the the We are the Souls video SoldierHawk was talking about. 

38:01 Grand Theft Auto V

Note that I’m going to spoil some of the points I’m going to make in my Grand Theft Auto series.

54:40 World of Warcraft

If you missed it, here is my write-up on the Cataclysm expansion.

<p><strong>01:03 Graphics card naming </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast</p>
<p>With Nvidia’s announcement of their new RTX 2000 cards and all their talk of Giga Rays it reminded me of a problem I used to have back when I worked in gaming retail.  </p>
<p>Due to the fact that most PC games had/have limited use one time codes we had a no returns policy on PC games which is obviously a problem for people who do not know if a particular game will run on their hardware.  Customers would often ask me if a particular game will run on their PC and I would try and answer to the best of my ability but sometimes it is not always easy to help.  Sometimes their hardware would be older or newer and I would have to try guesstimate how it compared to the listed requirements or they would ask why 2 graphics cards were so different in price or performance when they had the same amount of VRAM, etc.  </p>
<p><strong>My question at the end of all of this is could there be a better way to classify and quantify hardware performance so that people who are not experts can more easily figure out what they have and what they need?</strong></p>
<p>Regards Eric</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>10:51 Linux vs. Windows</strong>  </p>
<blockquote><p>Dear casters of die,</p>
<p>recently Steam released Proton, their custom Wine implementation allowing<br>
Linux users to run Windows games. Do you guys think this could cause a shift<br>
in the market?</p>
<p>As always, thanks for the great show!</p>
<p>-Tim</p></blockquote>
<p>Looking into this after the show, I can see why I didn’t hear about this sooner. Proton isn’t really ready for casual adoption yet. You can tell because you don’t get it from Valve. Instead, <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/">you get it from GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>On one hand, getting Windows games running on Linux is a HARD problem to solve. On the other hand, Valve has deep pockets and it <em>is</em> solvable. It’s too soon to tell right now, but it will be very interesting to see how this works out in the long term. Maybe this will be another SteamBox style failure, or maybe this will be another paradigm shift like Steam itself. Either way, it’s a good thing for PC Gamers. Anything that keeps Microsoft from getting too complacent is good for us.</p>

<p><strong>22:16 Bully</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear rollers of analogue pseudo random number generators,</p>
<p>I am back and I have an inquiry upon your opinions in regards to DLC. You might want to cut out the next bit for brevity.</p>
<p>The history of DLC since it inception is quite intriguing and turbulent. First there were cosmetic stuff and useless bits (Horse Armor). Followed by the wave of cut out content (Battle for Forli in AC2). Then there was the phase of some additional missions without anything really of interest in regards to gameplay and/or story. And lastly we had an increase of either mini expansions or experimental story/mission pieces. Things like the Fallout DLC comes to mind or the DLC packs for Mafia 3 and the newer Far Cry games (4 and beyond). The last thing i find especially interesting given that these are sometimes used to prototype mechanics and ideas for future games. Question: Do you think about this practice of using DLC as prototype testbed?</p>
<p>An addendum:<br>
<strong>You stated San Andreas is the best Rockstar game because it had heart. I personally think Bully is the best one for similar reasons even if most characters are asshats. Have you ever played Bully or would you consider trying it out?</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore I was wondering which kind of speedrun you prefer? The ones where one glitch is repeated over and over again and is abused ad absurdum or more of the technical kind where a lot of skills are being used?</p>
<p>Lastly:<br>
There is a lot of bashing going on in the direction of Ubisoft due to their open world games all being the same. Or at least sameish. I personally have the feeling that this open world sameyness already existed long before the Ubisoft formula was established. Sure Open World games are samey within their genre but if you compare entries from a specific developer you will always have quite a bit of sameness. Just Cause and Mad Max are somewhat self similar. But given your recent experiences with some Rockstar games would you say that they are similar to each other. I personally would extend them being similar to all Rockstar games be it GTA, Bully or Read Dead. Please discuss.</p>
<p>Cheers and a nice weekend from Austria,<br>
Gresman</p>
<p><strong>PS: Would you be willing to share the distribution of your readers over the globe if you have access to such data?</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I should add to what I said on the show: I loved Bully, but the classroom minigames were pretty bad. </p>
<p><strong>26:20 Distribution of readers</strong></p>
<p>Like I said on the show: We’re coming up on the anniversary of the site. I’ll do a post with a bunch of random factoids about the site. I suspect that post will happen next Tuesday, the 4th. If you have any questions about the readership of this site, the database that holds it, or the technology that holds it all together, now is the time to ask.</p>
<p><strong>26:59 Net Neutrality</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>To the last die caster.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on Net Neutrality now that it was officially repealed as law in the US?</p>
<p>I know that when you first wrote about it Net Neutrality was an unspoken rule no-one broke because it would ruin it for everyone, but since then companies started to break it and ruined it for everyone, which in turn forced the US government to sign it into law.</p>
<p>Now that companies are free to break it, and since they’ve clearly paid handsomely for this “benefit” they will, how would it affect American costumers? And how it would affect other countries that have their connection go through US cables, like South American costumers trying to access servers in Europe and the like?</p>
<p>signed,<br>
RCN, your Brazilian fan</p></blockquote>
<p>Whenever I caution people against talking politics, I always get a little pushback in the form of, “But Shamus, EVERYTHING is politics!” Note here that when I say “politics” I’m talking specifically about partisan politics of the classic Red vs. Blue variety. These arguments will always spiral into ugly tribalism. There will always be one or two people who feel the need to unleash their pent-up frustration and irritation on anyone from the Other Party. They mean well, but these arguments are a dead-end and I don’t care to watch my readers tear each other apart over things we can’t change.</p>
<p>To put it more specifically: I really enjoy abstract thought experiments talking about how you balance the desire for freedom against the need for regulation and the drawbacks of going too far in either direction. That’s an interesting discussion. For contrast, I don’t care what you think of Donald Trump or Ajit Pai and I don’t care to moderate the argument that will result if you decide to start an argument centered American partisan politics.</p>
<p>There are a lot of interesting topics this week. Please don’t make me close the comments because you can’t participate in this discussion without picking a fight.</p>
<p><strong>40:27 Modding</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Have you had any experience making mods? Of so, what’s the most/least fun you’ve had doing so? </p>
<p>Thanks, Echo Tango!</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/p-r/relive">Here is the Doom2 mod I made back in 1995</a>. That’s the last major mod I made. It’s also just before I got married. (The release date is actually just a couple of weeks after the wedding.) I imagine these two facts are at least somewhat related.</p>

01:03 Graphics card naming 

Dear Diecast
With Nvidia’s announcement of their new RTX 2000 cards and all their talk of Giga Rays it reminded me of a problem I used to have back when I worked in gaming retail.  
Due to the fact that most PC games had/have limited use one time codes we had a no returns policy on PC games which is obviously a problem for people who do not know if a particular game will run on their hardware.  Customers would often ask me if a particular game will run on their PC and I would try and answer to the best of my ability but sometimes it is not always easy to help.  Sometimes their hardware would be older or newer and I would have to try guesstimate how it compared to the listed requirements or they would ask why 2 graphics cards were so different in price or performance when they had the same amount of VRAM, etc.  
My question at the end of all of this is could there be a better way to classify and quantify hardware performance so that people who are not experts can more easily figure out what they have and what they need?

10:51 Linux vs. Windows  

Dear casters of die,
recently Steam released Proton, their custom Wine implementation allowing
Linux users to run Windows games. Do you guys think this could cause a shift
in the market?
As always, thanks for the great show!

        <![CDATA[<p>This is a special episode of the Diecast. If you’re looking for the usual brand of complaining, analysis, commentary, and complaining, then this is not the episode for you. Here I sit down with my wife Heather and we talk about our shared gaming history and how it impacted our relationship.</p>

<p>We weren’t really working from a fixed list of topics, so no show notes this week.</p>
<p>One final note is that this was recorded with Heather and I sitting at the same computer with an open microphone. Normally I do the show via VOIP and everyone has a key for push-to-talk. The setup we used this time means you’ll hear a little more background noise. So if you’re curious why you can hear my sniffing or the THUD of me setting down my silo-sized drink, now you know.</p>

Show notes: 

00:00 The Escapist Lives Again

I sort of already covered this yesterday, but this should be good if you were hoping for the more rambling, less concise version.

07:02 No Man’s Sky NEXT


My favorite part of the new update was when I found an alien named Dave.

On the show I said that the game wasn’t any better. That’s not entirely fair. The game is better in terms of the ratio between hassle and fun, but the changes don’t really get to the heart of the problem, which is that so much of the design is focused on highly repetitive tasks that put you under inventory pressure.

Imagine a game where you randomly fall out of the level and die every ten minutes or so, losing all your progress. Then imagine the patch makes it so you get more checkpoint saves. Yes, that’s a huge help, but it doesn’t really address the source of the problem. That’s what the No Man’s Sky NEXT update feels like.

19:34 Marco Polo

Anyone else out there use this? Like I said in the show, it’s completely supplanted texting in my family.

22:39 Titans

And speaking of generating traffic by making people angry…




I’m guessing they’re copying the look &amp; feel of the Marvel Netflix properties? If so, maybe the show will find an audience. I don’t care for that style of slow-burn serialized filler, but it’s really popular. 

34:24 Webhost Nightmares

On the show I said everything was up and running again. It turns out the RSS feed is wonky. I have no idea what’s wrong, but I’ve got multiple reports of it not updating properly. I’m looking into it.

Also, I just noticed the new host seems to have some curious throttling. I used to be able to download the audio of this showWhy do I download my own show? Issac uploads it, then I download it. This way I can make sure the link works. in one minute, and this week it took ten. What’s odd is that the site doesn’t seem to be slower overall. Curious.

29:25 Spec Ops: The Line

Heads up: SoldierHawk hasn’t played through to the end yet, which is why our conversation didn’t include those revelations.

48:58 Mailbag: Games based on real conflicts.

I know this topic skates around political-ish hotbutton topics. If we stepped on your toes, please try to be cool about it. 

Hello Diecast!
How do you feel about games that depict real-world wars and conflicts?
Does it make a difference if they’re historical, recent or ongoing?
Personally, I find it pretty tasteless to use ongoing conflicts as a
backdrop for some heroic power fantasy, because it seems too close to
propaganda.
Spec Ops is a different beast of course, but as far as I know, there
really aren’t any other games like it.
Going back in history, I find it strange that I’m uncomfortable with the
World Wars as settings, but not with anything before. They were extremely
brutal, of course, but so was the 30 Years War. I don’t know why it
should matter how far back you go, but it does seem to matter to me…

<p>Like I said in the show: My game and my novel have been stalled for the better part of a year, but then they both got un-stuck last week.

25:38 Voiced Protagonists




Hi!
Promise it will be a short one. Unlike the last time.
I’ve started to watch this video, but I’ve got a question on my own.
It’s about voice -d/-less protagonists. When the usage of either of them is justifiable/preferable? For example – would voiced protagonist improve System Shock 1/2, and what will it look like? Would removal of the voice of JC Denton make Deus Ex much worse? Do you have examples on your own to ponder on that question?

40:12 Prey Ending

Dear Diecast,
I finished Prey (2017) for the first time a few days ago. I loved it,
despite some flaws. I know you wrote a couple of posts on it back when
it came out, but would you mind discussing it a bit more, especially the
story? I’m curious what you thought about the ending twist; I liked it
but can see why some might not. Thanks!

They will update their APIs and Unity, Epic and Dice promised support.
What is your take on that shiny, new and expensive technology? Will it improve anything, that isn’t already accomplished? Will you try messing with it (after Pixel City Redux is completed/abandoned)?

<p><strong>17:23 Mail: Item Hoarding </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast</p>
<p>I was thinking about the “Too Valuable to use” problem in games where you have lots of rare and powerful items but you never use them because they are rare and valuable and you might need them later with the end result being that you finish the game with them just sitting in your inventory.  </p>
<p>What do you think that developers can do to avoid this problem in their games?</p>

Show notes:
00:00 Games Done Quick Marathon

I really do love this marathon. This run was the highlight of the show for me:




12:31 Shamus played Mass Effect Andromeda 

Like I said yesterday, I’ll be streaming Andromeda later this week.

17:23 Mail: Item Hoarding 

Dear Diecast
I was thinking about the “Too Valuable to use” problem in games where you have lots of rare and powerful items but you never use them because they are rare and valuable and you might need them later with the end result being that you finish the game with them just sitting in your inventory.  
What do you think that developers can do to avoid this problem in their games?
Regards
Eric

<p><strong>00:54 Hitmans, and changing your opinion on a game.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi!</p>
<p>That’s a non-question first, since I’ve just listened to episode 211 and since I’m late I have a feel, that a comment under it will be pointless. Sorry for this frivolousness on my part.</p>
<p>Anyway, about Thief vs Thief 2. I do prefer T2, but I saw enough people who preferred the first one, they saw T2 more boring, since it lacked diversity of levels and moods (less horror and tomb raiding). Actually, I thought just like you, and hated these levels. But I replayed a year later and… I loved these levels. They do work, they have their own mood, and sometimes it’s more fun to evade every obstacle by using acrobatics, instead of killing everyone. Thief 2 is still better, but Thief 1 isn’t that much worse. Deadly Shadow’s is enjoyable (I don’t think that game is worthless, even missions other than Shalebridge Cradle are pretty good and worth playing).</p>
<p><strong>I’m surprised with your comment about Hitman and Hitman 2. Hitman 2 is a vastly inferior game, flaws of which were inherited by Absolution.</strong> More linear levels (many of which without the targets, you must just pass them through), very easy to get your cover blown (you can’t even run, just slowly walk), very limited choices of dispatching the targets, and removing money system in favor of unlocks (in a game about contract killer!). Codename 47 wasn’t perfect game, very uneven I agree. But highs of C47 were way higher than highs of SA, and lows are relatively equal. Thankfully, IOI made Contracts and Blood Money. May be it’s just me, who views Silent Assassin on par with Absolution.</p>
<p>So… The question is (returning to that Thief question remark)… <strong>Were there games, that after replaying them, you drastically change your opinion on them, for better or worse?</strong></p>

<p><strong>15:16 Choosing Guns in Games</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,<br>
I also started playing Destiny 2 recently, and wanted to get your thoughts on the weapon design.<br>
As I see it, there are three variables that define the overall appeal of a weapon:<br>
Firstly, its raw stats, the things that are directly measured by the in game power level.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the utility/suitability of the weapon: things that make a weapon better or worse for a given environment or play-style; for example, a higher capacity, lower damage weapon when facing swarms, a shotgun instead of a sniper rifle when in narrow, twisting corridors, or a sight that highlights enemies when in dark areas.</p>
<p>Thirdly is the aesthetics of the weapon: how it looks and feels to use. (There are some definite winners &amp; losers in this category, in my, admittedly biased, opinion)</p>
<p>How much do you care about each aspect? Are you willing to put up with a gun that is statistically more powerful, and well suited to the environment, if it looks or feels bad? Are there weapons that were surpassed in stat power several levels ago, but you still use because it is far better suited to your needs?</p>
<p>I find this problem more notable then in other games (ie borderlands) because swapping weapons around eats ammo, which is most noticeable on the power (purple) weapons, which also happen to be, in my experience, the category which has the most specialized weapons, which need to be changed to fit the situation more often. They also have the lowest ammo stores.<br>
Between that and the relative lack of "safe" spaces to mess around with menus in, picking a well rounded loadout is key, as if something isn’t working, it’s not easy to swap it out.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>

<blockquote><p>Hello Diecast,</p>
<p>I’ve been wondering, <strong>is there any game that you often come back to and it still plays as good and feels as great as when you played it the first time? </strong></p>
<p>For me it’s Half-Life 2, everything just fits together so well… Also what do you think the secret to that kind of game is? IS it a mix of genuinely great game design and nostalgia?</p>
<p>Keep up the good work!</p>

<p><strong>29:24 Controller Complexity</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>How do you feel about 4 face buttons being a standard for all consoles. I’ve been playing a lot with my old xbox recently and noticed that the black and white buttons are neat for some extra functions. So, now electronics have advanced a lot, why wouldn’t they put on 2 more.</p>
<p>Imagine 4 shoulder buttons and 6 face buttons. Seeing how often games have multi-button presses or tap/hold or multifunctional buttons (search and swap weapon for example) it seems silly not to just give devs a few more facebuttons to work with.</p>

Hosts: Paul, Shamus. Episode edited by Issac.

Show notes: 00:00 Intellivision

I talked about this last week. 

For the record, this is the original Atari joystick:


The ridges at the base of the stick were perfect for trapping a mixture of dust and sweat in the grooves where you could always see it, but never properly clean it. The single-button interface smothered game design. The case was made of rigid plastic and was designed to fit the hands of an adult male, even though the machine was marketed to kids. Gaming was off to a rough start.

And when I talk about “affordances”, I’m referring to this Extra Credits episode. The game Paul was talking about was Striker.

15:19 The Story of Activision 

I related this story from memory without preparing beforehand. Hopefully I didn’t botch too many of the details. 

26:52 Technology Connections

Vacuum tubes were still in use when I was a kid. By the time I hit adulthood they were long gone, and I never went back to figure out what they were and how they worked. So this was pretty educational for me.




31:33 Paul’s Spaceship Game

Here is the Girl Genius art Paul made, and here is his thing on starship design.

47:52 Mailbag – flawed games. 

Dear crossers of the Rubicon,
While answering my question last week you (Shamus) stated something that resonated with me.
You said that you are sometimes buying games because they look intriguing. Furthermore you elaborated, that these games might be more interesting to discuss.
This leads to my point I once made in the comment section, where I theorized, that flawed games might be more interesting to analyze than those, really good or really bad.
As I see it great and aweful can be analyzed but only in one way. For one you have to extol its virtues and for the other you have to catalogue the shortcomings. That leads to it being somewhat boring. The worst games to discuss I found were those middle of the road, bland, average games, where the only thing to say is “It exists”.
But in my eyes the motherlode of this discussion topics can be found at the fringes of the “Meh-region”. With inhabitants like Mafia 3 and Far Cry 5.
Your thoughts on this?
Greeting
Gresman, who has no idea how to read or write phonetic alphabets
I think I got distracted on a tangent rather than answering Gresman’s question, so… oops.

Anyway, just look at this guy:


Oh gweat ledah, I’m pwoud to therf you in thith conqwetht of Erth.

It’s not just me, right? The guy on the right looks like a cartoon character with a hilarious speech defect, doesn’t he? Please tell me I’m not the only person who laughed at him.

<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast; </p>
<p>Two questions based on last week’s’ mod talk:</p>
<p>Firstly: Are there any games you play/played where the mods overtake the game, either partially or totally? My personal example is Arma3, where my ~370(!) mods take up over 130Gb compared to the game’s 32Gb. Total conversions also apply, or even simple/small mods (Frostfall for skyrim?) that take a game, and turn it into something completely different.</p>
<p>Secondly: In regards to modding for balance, you mentioned the recent XCOM games: while I modded my playthroughs so easy that I only lost a single soldier in beating both games, The popular mod for both EU and 2 was the "Long War" mod, which made the game significantly harder. What are your thoughts on using mods to adjust difficulty up or down? Do you think it’s a response to publishers not providing a wide enough range of difficulty options, or instead players choosing to play the game in their own style regardless of how it is intended to be played?</p>

<p>My question isn’t exactly really interesting, but, eh, it never really stopped me.</p>
<p>Let’s say you play a game that – for most of the time, e.g. 15 hours – is boring. But then it has this one moment/segment that’s trully awesome. It’s so good, it’s practically an art of its own.

<p>For example: for me Fallout 4 was… well, a rather boring game, but its DLC, “Far Harbor” was amazing. Would you play Fallout 4 just to get to this DLC?</p>
<p>I guess what I’m asking is: what’s better? A game that is consistently good but never really “awe inspiring”, or one that’s terribly flawed, but contains something truly mesmerizing? Since their length matters, let’s assume that both requires 25 hours to complete each.</p>

This came as a major shock to me because I played Thief: Gold about a year ago and borderline hated it. I think this is mostly down to level design. Thief Gold’s levels are gigantic, labyrinthine, an filled nonsensical copy pasted rooms. Not to mention a few them also seem to have and odd fixation on zombie killing as well. Thief 2 scales down the levels a bit, makes the maps more detailed, and makes each area memorable which leads to less aimless wondering. Also some levels seem to funnel players to the correct area somehow even thought there are several paths, but I’m not a level designer so I don’t know. My point is that while [they] are identical in many ways, the level design feels drastically different and it seems like people don’t talk about it very much. Perhaps its because people really just aren’t talking about thief all that much. I mean, I haven’t even used a guide for Thief 2, while I basically had to use one for every level on the first. Anyways, do you have a preference between the 2 games and have you noticed this difference? </p>
<p>P.S.<br>
There is this level in the first game where you have to pretend you are a Hammerite student and you have to solve this puzzle by finding and flipping a bunch of tiny switches very quickly and I just lost it. Like seriously, how did anyone figuire that out without the interenet??</p>

20:11 Mailbag: Games that “get good” late.

Hi, Diecast!
My question isn’t exactly really interesting, but, eh, it never really stopped me.
Let’s say you play a game that – for most of the time, e.g. 15 hours – is boring. But then it has this one moment/segment that’s trully awesome. It’s so good, it’s practically an art of its own. Life changing experience. How willing would you be to play such a game, knowing that in advance? Or even replay it?

Dear Diecast, 
I’m currently playing through Thief 2 for the first time (I’m 20) it might just turn out to be one of my favorite games I’ve ever played.

<p>Show notes:<span id="more-42740"></span><br>
<strong>00:00 Let’s talk about modding!</strong></p>
<p>Spoiler: We don’t begin to scratch the surface of the topic here. We focus a lot on the PC modding scene and don’t talk much about ROM hacks and the like.</p>
<p><strong>06:02 Game unplayable without mods?</strong></p>
<p>I wish I’d thought of this answer during the show, but Garry’s Mod strikes me as being a game that exists as a platform for mods and would be more or less pointless without them.</p>
<p><strong>11:00 Games that would be ruined by modding?</strong><br>
<strong>14:03 Games that would benefit from modding.</strong></p>
<p>As promised, here is what the game looks like with a shaderpack installed:</p>
<p></p><table border="0" class="nomargin" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/images/minecraft2018_shader.jpg?189db0&amp;189db0" class="imagefull" alt="I love it." title="I love it."></td></tr><tr><td class="insetcaptionx"><p class="mouseover_alt">I love it.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>

Show notes:
00:00 Let’s talk about modding!

Spoiler: We don’t begin to scratch the surface of the topic here. We focus a lot on the PC modding scene and don’t talk much about ROM hacks and the like.

06:02 Game unplayable without mods?

I wish I’d thought of this answer during the show, but Garry’s Mod strikes me as being a game that exists as a platform for mods and would be more or less pointless without them.

11:00 Games that would be ruined by modding?
14:03 Games that would benefit from modding.

As promised, here is what the game looks like with a shaderpack installed:


I love it.

To install this:

Get the Feed the Beast legacy launcher. Once you have it installed and running, find a modpack that sounds fun. I’m currently playing Direwolf20 for Minecraft 1.12.2Not sure if I’m into Direwolf yet. I just started.. Launch the game, make sure it works.

Exit the game and you’ll go back to the FTB launcher. Press the button that says “Open Modpack Folder”. That will open up an Explorer windowYeah, all of these directions are for Windows PC. If you’re on another platform you’ll have to figure this out for yourself. Good luck! that shows all of your mods. (There will be a lot.) Get a version of Optifine that matches the version of the modpack you’re running. If you’re playing Direwolf20, that’s 1.12.2. Download the file (you should get a .jar file) and place it in the folder you opened up a minute ago.

Fire up the game again. If you’re very lucky, it will work. If not… I have no idea. Sorry. It either means you downloaded the wrong version of Optifine, OR Optifine is randomly incompatible with one of the other dozens of mods. 

Fire up the game again. Yes, it takes five minutes to launch. Yes, every time. Yes, that’s absurd and even allowing for the inefficiencies of Java that’s probably a good order of magnitude larger than it should be. Like Paul said on the show, the world REALLY needs a version of Minecraft with native mod support.

Once you’re in the game (like, go into a world, not just at the menu) go to options » Video Settings » Shaders. This will take you to a screen where you can choose which shader you want to use. You don’t have any yet. There are dozens. Some are fantastic. Some are silly. Some are really slow. Many are broken. I’m currently using Wisdom shaders, which has these wonderful moving clouds.

From this shader-selection screen in Minecraft you can open up the shader folder. Do so, then take the shader you downloaded and put it in there. At this point you should be able to switch to the shader without needing to restart the game. Sometimes changing shaders will force the game to dump and reload all texture data, which takes a good 30 seconds. It will feel like MC locked up, but it should still be good. Wait it out. 

I don’t know if this will work for you, but that’s the procedure I follow. Good luck!

Dear Diecast,
my friends are fond of saying “the only good code is your code, and only if you’ve worked on that codebase continuously / from the beginning”. Do you agree with that sentiment?
And on a related note, is there one thing you just wish every programmer would do or stop doing, and if so, what is it?

01:27 Factorio vs. Minecraft

You were fishing for subjects in the last podcast. I’d be curious to hear some chatter comparing the progression and endgame of modded (industrial) Minecraft, Factorio and any similar games you’ve played.
It’s my personal impression that this is much more clearly thought through and balanced in Factorio, I think due to it being a more focused team, maybe you disagree.

25:28 Max Payne

As promised on the show, I read and answered this question…

I’m interested to know if the hosts have played the Max Payne games, and if so, what they think of the series? The first two were well-received by critics and the public alike, although I believe the second sold well below what Remedy had hoped. This probably contributed to the decade-long gap between the release of the second game and the third, as well as the change of developer to Rockstar Studios.
Max Payne 3 is interesting in comparison to the preceding games, and for all the decisions Rockstar made about what to imitate and where to diverge, not only in terms of gameplay mechanics but also narrative, setting and tone. It’s also interesting to consider what effect the 10 year advance in industrial trends might have had for the project, from both a design and a commercial perspective. It was a divisive game (to put it mildly) and I’d be really interested to hear your thoughts about it, should you have any.

07:31 Minecraft Scripting fun. 

Here are the Minecraft scripts Paul was talking about.

23:11 La Mesa, Texas

Any other cities that are flagrantly mispronounced?

25:29 Aer. Fun little game. Low poly art-style.

34:22 [Failing at] starting a business.

If you missed it, this is the game I’m trying to release on Steam.

We both blanked out on the names of things in Half-Life. I said “Overseer” but the thing I was thinking of is Adviser. Also, we briefly confused Stalker with Strider.

The hurdle of “You can’t talk about a game until you get all the endings” creates an awful selection bias where the only people supposedly “qualified” to discuss the game are people that loved it and were able to run it properly. </p>

00:00 Paul’s Fabulous Recording Coffin




07:12 Playing Nier: Automata

I talked about the game on the Shamecast last week. Every time I try to describe this game, the plot, the premise, or the characters, someone will jump in with a “Well, ACTUALLY Shamus, you haven’t seen the real ending, see it’s not really about…”

Yeah yeah yeah. I get it. But look, I can’t discuss the parts of the game I haven’t seen. I was more than fair to Nier. I put up with the crashes to get to the first ending or whatever. I got partway through another playthrough. It’s not my fault this game is unstable. Our options are to talk about the parts of the game I’ve seen or to not talk about the game at all. The hurdle of “You can’t talk about a game until you get all the endings” creates an awful selection bias where the only people supposedly “qualified” to discuss the game are people that loved it and were able to run it properly. 




21:12 Survival games and the conceit of self-sufficiency

The old post I was referring to was Game Developers at the Beach, which has always been one of my favorites but never seems to get a lot of love in terms of being cited / referenced / linked / discussed. (Maybe it needs a rewrite.) Some people try to see the allegorical rivalry between Will Wright and Cliff Bleszinski as a conflict between a protagonist and a villain, or between a boring nerd and someone who knows how to have fun, but really it’s not supposed to be an attack on either personality. These conflicting goals simply exist, and always will exist, and I think we’ll understand our games better when we have a more complete picture of why those “other people” play them.

If you like the idea of Paul and I playing Left 4 Dead together, then you can watch it happen this coming Wednesday.

39:00 Work-life balance, burnout, taking a break

        <![CDATA[<p>Heads up: An enterprising reader has created <a href="https://mbafford-static.s3.amazonaws.com/diecast.xml">their own RSS feed</a> for the show. I don’t use RSS often enough to appraise it, so let me know how it works for you. If it’s good and does what we need, I’d be happy to make this the official feed.</p>
<p>Good news for those of you who enjoyed SolderHawk’s visit in the previous episode: She’s going to come back and visit again in a few weeks.</p>

<strong>00:09 Mailbag</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast</p>
<p>This week the community is doing <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-massive-bloodborne-community-event-is-happening-right-1823671312">a Return to Bloodborne event</a>, which just means encouraging people to create a new character and go through the game again while using all of the online features. A similar event was done yearly for Demon’s Souls, which had its servers shut down earlier this year. </p>
<p>Which older game that you like would you participate in such an event for?</p>
<p>Love, Christopher </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>03:21 Kerbal Space Program</strong></p>
<p>The new DLC (which we shamefully didn’t name in the show) is called “Making History”. The stellar Scott Manley can give you a pretty good overview of what the new features are:</p>

<p><strong>08:00 Issac played Deus Ex: Human Revolution</strong></p>
<p>My son: This doesn’t work for me.</p>
<p>Me: That’s my boy!</p>
<p><strong>13:57 SubNautica</strong></p>
<p>Here is the first episode of the Let’s Play that Paul was talking about:</p>
<p></p><p></p>

      <itunes:summary>Heads up: An enterprising reader has created their own RSS feed for the show. I don’t use RSS often enough to appraise it, so let me know how it works for you. If it’s good and does what we need, I’d be happy to make this the official feed.

Good news for those of you who enjoyed SolderHawk’s visit in the previous episode: She’s going to come back and visit again in a few weeks.


Hosts: Paul, Shamus.

Show notes:
00:09 Mailbag

Dear Diecast
This week the community is doing a Return to Bloodborne event, which just means encouraging people to create a new character and go through the game again while using all of the online features. A similar event was done yearly for Demon’s Souls, which had its servers shut down earlier this year. 
Which older game that you like would you participate in such an event for?
Love, Christopher 
03:21 Kerbal Space Program

The new DLC (which we shamefully didn’t name in the show) is called “Making History”. The stellar Scott Manley can give you a pretty good overview of what the new features are:




08:00 Issac played Deus Ex: Human Revolution

My son: This doesn’t work for me.

Me: That’s my boy!

Here is the first episode of the Let’s Play that Paul was talking about:

I have better things to do than move my site again, after the last move was such a nightmare. And I’m paid up for the year and I’d hate to see that cash go to waste. But this host is ticking time bomb.

36:50 Affinity / Photoshop replacement

I can’t believe I’ve found a possible replacement for the venerable Paint Shop Pro 8.

<p><strong>4:08 Mailbag – Why So Nitpicky?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi!</p>
<p>First of all, I apologize in advance for any mistakes that I’ve made. English is not my native language (polish is). This whole e-mail is probably gibberish (especially since it’s the first mail in foreign language for me), but I’ll try to ask a question anyway. </p>
<p>Second: big fan of your work. I just wanted to say that.</p>
<p>Anyway, my question to Shamus, Paul and Bob is:<br>
I’ve recently watched MrBtongue episode called “TUN: The Shandification of Fallout”. In one section, you criticized the way Fallout 3 handled the logic of it’s own world, comparing it to much more well-thought worldbuilding of Fallout: New Vegas (what do they eat? e.g. Megaton vs Goodspring). I’ve also read Shamus retrospection of the Mass Effect series (THE WHOLE THING). It’s makes me wonder, to what extent the games like that should justify the events they’re presenting – since if we were going to logically deconstruct everything in fictional world, eventually nothing would remain. So my question (finally) is: in which point the game should stop explaining it’s own world? To what degree the fictional world of that kind of games should be logically construct? Is there a clean line to be drawn? And how much of a game’s world should be just made-up? </p>
<p>(I’m not gonna lie, your language is pretty funny; hope the question is not too long, I couldn’t help myself – I mean, the Bob himself is here!)</p>
<p>Cheers to the whole crew of Diecast and hope you’re going to have a great time!<br>
Sincerely,</p>
<p>Darek (hmm… “Darius” I guess?)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>14:36 Mailbag – How Would You Have Written It?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hey Shamus,</p>
<p>I have a (multi-part) question I’d like to ask both Bob and you. There’s a minor hitch, though.</p>
<p>It’s about Mass Effect.</p>
<p>No, wait! Let me explain!</p>
<p>I want to make something absolutely clear before I proceed: if you don’t want to hear about the subject any more, or put it on the podcast, I totally understand. Both you and Bob have covered the series in the past many many times over in various formats, and I don’t blame you if you just stop reading right here, right now. If that’s the case, I guess all that’s left is for me to thank you both from the bottom of my heart for all the time and effort you’ve put into discussing and deconstructing the ME games. Your analyses are amazing and I think it wouldn’t be an exaggeration if I said that they have helped me immensely to grow not only as a fan of the series, but as a consumer of pop culture in general. You guys are the best, and I love you both forever. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3

Now, on the off chance that enough time has passed for you not to be completely sick of hearing about Mass Effect, here is my question (for the sake of convenience I'm leaving it in its original format, which was conceived before I wrote this prolonged introductory bit, so there are some redundancies -- sorry about that):

"It's probably fair to say that you have spent a significant amount of time deconstructing the Mass Effect series, especially following the ending of the game that I personally choose to believe was never made. In the process you have acquired a great understanding of the series, which you have shared with your audience on multiple occasions. But did you ever create, or toyed with the idea of creating, an alternate Mass Effect canon for yourself, based on your analysis of the games, your personal preference, and how you believe the story should have went?

If so, what would your "break-off point" be? What is the moment where you substitute your own story for the one proposed by the writer? Is it the infamous ending, the opening of the third game when the whole series went full anthropocentric, or even earlier, like when Shepard got blown out of the Normandy and died, only to be immediately resurrected (following atmospheric re-entry)? Do you include Andromeda at all (I'm completely ignoring it as I haven't played it, but for you it can be different)?

Basically, tell us about your Mass Effect headcanon, if you have any :) ."

Thanks for taking the time to read this. Take good care of yourselves and greetings from Poland (where it's currently freezing -- hope the winter isn't too hard on you stateside).

Love you guys,
Pawe?</p></blockquote>
<p>Correction: In this section I say that you work for Lester in Grand Theft Auto Online, and don’t meet the other characters. I just noticed on the Wiki that this isn’t the case. There’s quite a bit more to the game if you stick with it.</p>
<p><strong>31:25 Mailbag – Forbidden Adaptations.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear The Diecast,</p>
<p>Are there any books/films/concept albums/TV shows/other things that should be barred from being made into games, and if so why?</p>
<p>Cheers, Neil from England.</p></blockquote>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>It’s been a while since we talked about programming around here. But this week Paul and I brush up against the topic. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Hosts: <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/">Shamus</a> and <a href="http://peripheralarbor.com/">Paul</a>. Episode edited by <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198087035658/">Issac</a>.<br>
Show notes:<span id="more-42033"></span><br>
<b>00:35 The System Shock Kickstarter debacle.</b></p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598858095/system-shock/posts/2115044">the failure announcement</a> from the team. Like I said in the show, I’ll be covering this in more detail tomorrow. </p>
<p>In our talk, I claimed “we never saw any gameplay”. Technically, they do show you hitting zombies with a wrench. They showed that in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdWiZ48RZ88#t=4m20s">original Kickstarter video</a> in 2016, and we saw they finally got back to that point just before the project was canceled. So it would be more correct to say they didn’t make any progress on gameplay, or that we didn’t see any <strong>new</strong> gameplay. </p>
<p>Also a lot of what I said was conjecture.</p>
<p><strong>21:18  Creeper World</strong></p>
<p>Here is <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/280220/Creeper_World_3_Arc_Eternal/">Creeper World 3</a> on Steam.</p>
<p><strong>30:49  Having fun while playing Factorio with cheats.</strong></p>
<p></p><table border="0" class="nomargin" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/images/factorio_base2.jpg?189db0&amp;189db0" class="imagefull" alt="This is the goal of the game. Just launch this rocket. It's super easy!" title="This is the goal of the game. Just launch this rocket. It's super easy!"></td></tr><tr><td class="insetcaptionx"><p class="mouseover_alt">This is the goal of the game. Just launch this rocket. It's super easy!</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
<p>For the record, I play with a mix of cheats and mods. I use the long reach mod to avoid having to walk into a nest of conveyor belts and grabber arms to reach the machine I want to interact with. </p>
<p>I really wish there was a mod that let you beautify your base. Trees, signage, that sort of thing. Usually by the time I’m done the thing is a square mile of pavement and electrical wires and it looks sort of depressing.</p>
<p><strong>42:37 Hey You! Bob Case is going to be on the next Diecast. Send us some questions for him. </strong></p>
<p>(Email in the header image.)</p>
<p><strong>45:17 What happened to Project Frontier and Project Octree?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbpMiKiSKm8">Here are the Unity tutorials I talked about</a>. It’s probably the best overview of the process of starting with basic numbers and building up your own scenery. A shame they’re in video form.</p>
<p>I wish I had time for this sort of thing.</p>

      <itunes:summary>It’s been a while since we talked about programming around here. But this week Paul and I brush up against the topic. 



Hosts: Shamus and Paul. Episode edited by Issac.
Show notes:
00:35 The System Shock Kickstarter debacle.

Here is the failure announcement from the team. Like I said in the show, I’ll be covering this in more detail tomorrow. 

In our talk, I claimed “we never saw any gameplay”. Technically, they do show you hitting zombies with a wrench. They showed that in the original Kickstarter video in 2016, and we saw they finally got back to that point just before the project was canceled. So it would be more correct to say they didn’t make any progress on gameplay, or that we didn’t see any new gameplay. 

Also a lot of what I said was conjecture.

21:18  Creeper World

Here is Creeper World 3 on Steam.

30:49  Having fun while playing Factorio with cheats.


This is the goal of the game. Just launch this rocket. It’s super easy!

For the record, I play with a mix of cheats and mods. I use the long reach mod to avoid having to walk into a nest of conveyor belts and grabber arms to reach the machine I want to interact with. 

I really wish there was a mod that let you beautify your base. Trees, signage, that sort of thing. Usually by the time I’m done the thing is a square mile of pavement and electrical wires and it looks sort of depressing.

42:37 Hey You! Bob Case is going to be on the next Diecast. Send us some questions for him. 

(Email in the header image.)

45:17 What happened to Project Frontier and Project Octree?

Here are the Unity tutorials I talked about. It’s probably the best overview of the process of starting with basic numbers and building up your own scenery. A shame they’re in video form.

I wish I had time for this sort of thing.

<p>The podcast-specific RSS feed is broken and isn’t going to be fixed anytime soon. I’ve tried a number of plugins for making podcast stuff, and most of them overbearing, overcomplicated things that assume your blog only exists to host a podcast. Also, I always get complaints that the RSS feed doesn’t work in iTunes or whatever, which is <em>the only thing I want the plugin to do</em>.</p>
<p>People are always telling me how easy and turnkey it is and how service X or plugin Y fixed everything, and it always ends up eating a bunch of time, causing confusion, and failing to work as advertised. I don’t know what sort of hassle you’re supposed to go through to get podcasting RSS to work, but it’s evidently more hassle than I’m willing to put up with. </p>

In the Spoiler Warning episode for Contradiction, you said your wife was enthused about the game as soon as she saw it.  Did she ever follow up and play it?

<p>Funny story about this episode: I noticed Baychel sounded off, but for some unfathomable reason I didn’t say anything until <strong>after</strong> we’d recorded the show. Once I did, she discovered her good mic had come unplugged and the system had defaulted to using her crappy webcam mic. Sad trombone.</p>

Caveat emptor!

0:13:36: Mailbag: Story vs. Gameplay

Dear Diecast
If you were about to play a standard 15-20 hour triple A game, would you rather it had an amazing story… but dreadful gameplay, or amazing gameplay and a terrible story? 
Sarah. 
0:27:28: Mailbag: Spider-Man Homecoming

What’s up Dear Diecast 
Are you looking forward to the new Spider-Man movie? Apart from some personal “It’s different and therefore it’s RUINED” complaints, I’m pretty hyped to see a Spider-Man movie in Marvel Studios’ hands. 
Your friendly neighborhood Christopher
0:46:07: Destiny 2 coming to PC

So naturally we spend this whole segment complaining about the first game. Still, I really like this trailer:




The Kotaku story Chris quoted is here: The Messy, True Story Behind The Making Of Destiny. And this is the quote:

“Let’s say a designer wants to go in and move a resource node two inches,” said one person familiar with the engine. “They go into the editor. First they have to load their map overnight. It takes eight hours to input their map overnight. They get [into the office] in the morning. If their importer didn’t fail, they open the map. It takes about 20 minutes to open. They go in and they move that node two feet. And then they’d do a 15-20 minute compile. Just to do a half-second change.”
Just shameful. It’s a miracle they shipped at all.

<strong>00:00:55: Overwatch</strong></p>
<p>Baychel played the game for the first time this week. Here’s what she thought. You can read more of her thoughts on <a href="https://bayberrystudio.wordpress.com/2017/03/06/overwatch-and-rewards/">her blog</a>.</p>
<p><strong>00:12:10: Horizon: Zero Dawn</strong></p>
<p>It’s out! And it’s good! It’s not nearly as Ubisoft-esque as we feared. </p>
<p><strong>00:32:59: Borderlands 2</strong></p>
<p>I’m back into the game, and playing multiplayer with the family. This game follows a very similar cycle to Diablo II. Obsession leads to burnout. Burnout leads to dormancy. A few years of dormancy results in renewed interest. Renewed interest leads back to obsession.</p>
<p>To add to this, I think Borderlands 2 has my favorite game trailer of all time:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>And because I know you’ll ask: Yes, I saw the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cw2gXq83n8">Gearbox talk on rendering tech that featured likely assets for Borderlands 3</a>. I might do a post on this at some point.</p>
<p><strong>00:45:52: Zelda Breath of the Wild</strong></p>
<p>Chris has been playing it on the Wii U. </p>

Show notes:
00:00:55: Overwatch

Baychel played the game for the first time this week. Here’s what she thought. You can read more of her thoughts on her blog.

00:12:10: Horizon: Zero Dawn

It’s out! And it’s good! It’s not nearly as Ubisoft-esque as we feared. 

00:32:59: Borderlands 2

I’m back into the game, and playing multiplayer with the family. This game follows a very similar cycle to Diablo II. Obsession leads to burnout. Burnout leads to dormancy. A few years of dormancy results in renewed interest. Renewed interest leads back to obsession.

To add to this, I think Borderlands 2 has my favorite game trailer of all time:




And because I know you’ll ask: Yes, I saw the Gearbox talk on rendering tech that featured likely assets for Borderlands 3. I might do a post on this at some point.

00:45:52: Zelda Breath of the Wild

Chris has been playing it on the Wii U.

<p>I think I need to stop getting excited when people say a game is “like Silent Hill”, because that phrase apparently means something different to me than to everyone else. When I hear it I think, “Horror that focuses on unease and foreboding of mystery rather than jumpscares and the stress of combat.” When other people say a game is like Silent Hill I think they mean, “Has fog.”</p>
<p>I think that “Shivercliff” might be the most on-the-nose spooky town name since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkness_Falls_(2003_film)">Darkness Falls</a>.</p>

<p>I’m willing to bet Josh isn’t the only one who preferred the original, but I’m interested to see what people have to say about it.</p>
<p>I said in the show that the Pre-Sequel kinda ruined the game for me. I loved playing as Athena to the point where she’s the only character I ever want to play, but I hate the environments and enemies in that game. So then I want to go back to Borderlands 2, but then realized I wouldn’t be able to play as Athena. </p>
<p>I dunno if they’re making another one of these things, but if they are it must be a long ways off. They haven’t even begun hinting that they might talk about it. I suspect they’re spending all their time on Battleborn.</p>

Also, Baychel hasn’t really been introduced to the community except for the <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=26597">Crypt of the Necrodancer</a> review, and the fact that she edits the podcast.

      <itunes:summary>Hosts: Josh, Rutskarn, Shamus, Cyril Figgis. Edited by Baychel.

I made announcements at the top of the show, but I forgot the most important one: Next week we’re going to do a bunch of mailbag questions. Also, Baychel hasn’t really been introduced to the community except for the Crypt of the Necrodancer review, and the fact that she edits the podcast. So now’s your chance to get to know her. Ask some questions.

As always, the email address is in the image at the top of this post.

Show notes:
0:2:00: Streaming Television is a wasteland.

This was supposed to be a quick announcement, and instead it’s a five minute digression.

0:5:51: New Content!

I guess I should re-announce this here for the benefit of all you folks who read the site but ignore the media content: Bob Case (The Tasteful Understated Nerdrage guy) will be contributing to the site. He’s doing an analysis on Game of Thrones. The first entry should go up on Friday. Maybe if we’re really nice to him he’ll be willing to stick around and nitpick things for us.

0:7:51: New Game project!

MAYBE. A week from tomorrow I’m going to put it up for download and we’ll see what everyone thinks of it. It’s technically “done” in the sense of being feature-complete, but there’s a pretty long road between feature-complete and actually complete. 

0:12:52: XCom 2

0:41:34: Chris is playing Steep

Apparently Uplay is getting better-ish?

0:51:33: Josh is playing competitive Overwatch

0:59:00: Crusader Kings

I don’t understand any of this but I’m sure it’s cool.

<p>It’s been ages since I did a videogame podcast and I don’t quite remember how it goes, but the guys assured me the show should start with about 20 minutes of random non-videogame bullshit. </p>

<strong>0:02:03: Favorite Jokes</strong></p>
<p>We talked about our favorite jokes. Here is mine:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>I laughed at this joke when I saw it in ~1996. I laughed at it every time I saw it afterwards. I laughed every time my brother quoted it at me in the early 2000’s. I laughed at it when I tried to repeat the joke on the show. I laughed at it when I looked up the video just now. </p>
<p>I dunno. It’s like this is the Everlasting Gobstopper of jokes. It never runs out for me.</p>
<p><strong>0:05:37: Man Walks Into a Bar</strong></p>
<p>A horse walks into a bar. The bartender looks at him and says, “Why the long face?”</p>
<p>This segment isn’t so much about the “Man walks into a bar” style of joke as it is about how we visualize jokes in our head. </p>
<p>I’ve mentioned Martin’s Bar before. If you’re trying to keep the continuity of your whole Shamus backstory straight, it was mentioned in <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=13314">this grim chapter</a> of my childhood. The building is still standing today, but it’s empty now. You can see it <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/411+E+Locust+St,+Butler,+PA+16001/@40.862801,-79.8911607,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x883362ee8c57afb3:0x1f96429f101796ab!8m2!3d40.862797!4d-79.888972">here</a>. (It’s the red brick building facing the corner.)</p>
<p>I suppose this means the Battlezone machine is gone.</p>
<p><strong>0:20:23: ASMR Videos</strong></p>
<p>As it’s been described to me, ASMR videos are designed to trigger that feeling of tingling excitement you get when you’re extremely happy. The sensation where you get goosebumps due to your overwhelming emotional state, and you feel simultaneously excited and yet serene. The last time I remember having that sensation was 1982. I was sitting on the couch by myself. The family had just set up the Christmas decorations and I was sitting in the darkened living room, staring at the constellations of colorful lights. Soft Christmas music was playing. I remember having this meta-thought about how soon this perfect moment would end, so I tried to memorize as much as I could. (And yet, I can’t remember what music was playing.)</p>
<p>I’ll probably never feel like that again. But maybe I should watch the Happy Gilmore clip a few more times to see if that does the trick.</p>
<p><strong>0:22:31: XCom 2</strong></p>
<p>My favorite part of the Xcom story is the part where I remembered that Bradley existed. Or was it Bradford? </p>
<p>Ah well. Whoever.</p>
<p><strong>0:37:42: FINAL Fantasy</strong></p>
<p>Josh has been playing the very last fantasy game. </p>
<p><strong>0:55:22: Dishonored 2</strong></p>
<p>Chris has just finished Dishonored 2.</p>
<p><strong>1:12:02: GTA V</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been playing GTA V for some reason. I have a love-hate relationship with this game. Parts of it are extraordinary. Parts of it sicken me. Other parts are just pathetic and irritating. </p>

A horse walks into a bar. The bartender looks at him and says, “Why the long face?”

This segment isn’t so much about the “Man walks into a bar” style of joke as it is about how we visualize jokes in our head.

0:01:00 Meandering conversation

0:06:00 Rogue One: A Star Wars Story

Here the cast discusses the news Star Wars movie. Not to worry, there’s no spoilers because they get distracted and talk about popcorn for twenty minutes.

0:25:00 Super Mario Runner

Also the cast talks about barcades, Dave &amp; Busters, and the state of modern arcade experiences.

<p>With both Shamus and Mumbles out, Rutskarn proposed something a little different for this show: Before we started, he asked twitter for game pitches. The following podcast is our attempt to design them.</p>
<p>The pitches:</p>

Episode edited by <a href="http://www.blueberrystarstudio.com/site/">Rachel</a>.<p></p>
<p>Like I said on the show: I’m going to be travelling during the second week in December. I’m not sure how well I’ll be able to keep up with comments, or if I’ll be able to queue up enough content to get us through. </p>
<p>Also, things may be disrupted a bit <em>this</em> week because I’m moving my home office.</p>
<p>My daughter Rachel moved out in early 2016. We left her room empty for a while, just in case she boomerang’d. But it’s been over half a year and she’s living stable, so I think she’s out for good. So we moved my son Issac into her room, and I’m taking Issac’s old room. This is a pretty big step for me. For two years I’ve been running this site from my living room where I’m constantly distracted by the television, guests, stuff going on in the kitchen, people playing music, people chattering on the phone, and a dozen other living-room things. But now I’m going to have my own room with a door.</p>
<p>That’s all good for the long-term, but in the short term it means tearing apart this gigantic command center of equipment and re-assembling it in another room. I know that’s bound to disrupt things around here, so please be patient if I’m worse than usual at moderating comments and answering emails.</p>
<p>Show notes:<span id="more-35660"></span><br>
<strong>0:00:33: Tablet Computer Q&amp;A</strong><br>
I’m looking for a machine that can let me create content and admin this site. At the same time, we really don’t have a lot of money right now, since we’re spending it on the trip. </p>
<p>On the show I said we were looking at a Surface 2 Pro. I was wrong. The model my wife suggested is the Microsoft Surface, which is currently under $150 and comes with a keyboard. (Compare to Surface 2, which is around double that without the keyboard.) The other wrinkle is that after the trip, I won’t really have use for either device. But if we get the Surface, my wife could use it for digital art. So Chromebook is cheaper but useless once the trip is over, while Surface is more expensive but potentially will continue to be useful after the trip. The best way I can think of to make this decision is to gather as much information as possible before choosing.</p>
<p>So, anyone have any general advice for these devices? Things to watch out for? Have you used a Surface, or a Chromebook? Sure, I can read random reviews, but I find our discussions here to be a lot more useful.</p>
<p><strong>0:09:36: <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2016/11/24/13743236/ubisoft-vivendi-takeover">Ubisoft exec says Vivendi takeover could “Damage culture of innovation.”</a></strong></p>
<p>I talked (snarked) about this on Twitter, and the response I got from a lot of people was “What about Child of Light and Valiant Hearts!?” as if I was being unfair. </p>
<p>Sure, once every few years Ubi puts out something experimental and different. But the vast bulk of their resources go into making a bunch of games that feel very similar and feel like design by focus group rather than having any sort of creative spark. It’s not that they never do anything interesting, it’s that claiming to have a “culture of innovation” is like saying that Batman has a “mirthful personality” because he’s gotten nailed by the Joker’s laughing gas a couple of times.</p>
<p><strong>0:25:38: Josh and the 3DS</strong></p>
<p><strong>0:42:55: Pokemon Sun &amp; Moon</strong></p>
<p>Having never played a Pokemon game, it’s amazing to me just how impenetrable this stuff gets. I think this is a good thing. It irritates me when people are dismissive towards Pokemon because the premise (capture animals and train them to fight) is simple. Mechanically, I’d say this game sounds pretty deep.</p>
<p><strong>0:57:57: Physical Sales are down.</strong></p>
<p>Stipulated: Discussing boxed sales and ignoring digital sales doesn’t paint a full picture of events. Having said that, this does make for an interesting collection of headlines:</p>

Dear Diecast,
It’s been said before that video RPGs tend to use fantasy settings and themes. I’d like to discus how fantasy RPGs tend to specifically be epic fantasy.
There doesn’t tend to be video RPGs based on sword and sorcery like from Robert E. Howard, literary fantasy like from Mervyn Peake, nor humorous fantasy like from Terry Pratchett (full disclosure: some of these authors I haven’t actually read). I’d imagine that epic fantasy RPGs are common due to company forces like publishers and marketers, as well as game design considerations like a focus on combat excluding things like Peake. Though when Obsidian went independent with Pillars of Eternity they also made it epic fantasy.
This makes me curious about whether the popularity of epic fantasy in RPGs is due to customer demand or just plain tradition?
Cheers,
Aaron

<p>Okay, they took the original HD Pack textures and just literally scaled them up. So a 1024×1024 texture becomes 2048×2048. But that’s like enlarging a photograph. Making something bigger doesn’t ADD detail. Modern graphics cards already smooth rough pixel edges, so NOTHING is gained by doing this.

<p>As promised last week, we answer listener questions. As always, the show email is in the header image.</p>
<p>Show notes:<span id="more-34928"></span><br>
<strong>0:01:07: Star Trek: The Next Generation: The Commentary Track</strong></p>
<p>Note that I WAY overestimated how much audio / video content we’ve produced. Spoiler Warning channel has 780 videos with an average length of about half an hour, for a total of 390 hours of video. Then there’s about 200 hours of Diecast, assuming an average length of 1.2 hours each. That’s a lot, but where nowhere near the 1,000 hours I guessed during the show. </p>
<p>To reiterate what I said on the show: I’m spread too thin to do more projects. What I really <em>want</em> to do is make more Reset Button videos, but producing one video takes something like 20 hours, and I know I don’t have that many spare hours. </p>
<p>Josh is pitching an idea that might only take me 2 hours to produce. We’d watch an episode of Trek, make a commentary track, and then you could download it and play it along with the show.

As promised last week, we answer listener questions. As always, the show email is in the header image.

Show notes:
0:01:07: Star Trek: The Next Generation: The Commentary Track

Note that I WAY overestimated how much audio / video content we’ve produced. Spoiler Warning channel has 780 videos with an average length of about half an hour, for a total of 390 hours of video. Then there’s about 200 hours of Diecast, assuming an average length of 1.2 hours each. That’s a lot, but where nowhere near the 1,000 hours I guessed during the show. 

To reiterate what I said on the show: I’m spread too thin to do more projects. What I really want to do is make more Reset Button videos, but producing one video takes something like 20 hours, and I know I don’t have that many spare hours. 

Josh is pitching an idea that might only take me 2 hours to produce. We’d watch an episode of Trek, make a commentary track, and then you could download it and play it along with the show. Josh’s idea has the advantage that it would take me 2 hours to produce 1 hour of content. This is opposed to an article, which might take 6 hours to produce 5 minutes of reading or a Reset Button video, where it would take 20 hours to make 10 minutes worth of content. 

Does Trek commentary sound like something you’d enjoy? Something that might be worth sharing? Something that might be worth another trip to the site every day? I’d love you hear your thoughts.

0:08:42: How would Bethesda respond to your show?

Dear Casters of the Die,
Do you think Bethesda would be surprised by your criticisms? Do you imagine them more as people who would say, “I know, I know, but time and money…” or as people who would laugh and say, “If our games suck so much, why are we selling so many copies?” Or something else?

0:15:46: The game the broke you.

Is there a game that “broke you” as a fan, so to speak. Turning you from young optimistic fans into the cynics we know and love. 
-Joe
0:31:56: Dream guest.

Dear Diecast,
If you could get any guest to come on the show, who would it be?
Best regards,
Jared
For the record, I was talking about Mr. Btongue, and this is the video where he mentioned me. Mumbles was talking about Ability Drain. Also, don’t miss George’s trip to Japanese arcades. It’s gold. Chris mentioned Lazy Game Reviews, which is stellar.

0:42:28: Videogame websites.

Dear Diecast
Which video game websites do you like? Both for news and entertainment. I know Josh mentions Giant Bomb sometimes, what about the rest of you?
Love, Christopher
Here’s the Oxenfree video we mentioned:




Josh said we don’t know anyone at the Escapist, but the truth is there are still a few people there I have occasional contact with. I also really like columnist Liz Finnegan and John Markley, who runs the stream.

1:01:21: How I met your podcast.

Dear Diecast,
Which mailbag question do you really wish you’d answered at the time but is now embarrassingly out of date or irrelevant?
-Neko ;)
My curiosity is simply how the (regular) five of you all met up and decided to do all these podcasts and let’s plays and the such. Apologies if this was answered in another diecast but I’m working backwards from present time and I’m only at 138. You guys have done alot of stuff, it’s almost overwhelming! 
Cheers, Jared.
1:11:58: Game of the century.

Dear Diecast
What’s your favorite game from the last sixteen years? How about your favorite game that’s older than that?
Love, Christopher

<p>True story: I don’t touch-type.

<p>See, by the time I got around to taking a touch-typing course in high school I’d already been typing for about five years.

<p>So I type with the first three fingers on each hand, mostly while looking down at the keyboard. It’s ghastly slow compared to touch-typing, but the overhead of fixing it is just too costly.

<p>If I was going to invest time into something ambitious like that, I’d want to spend it on learning <strong>new</strong> things (like learning to play the guitar) rather than re-learning my core skills so that I can type faster. Especially since I’m not sure how much of a productivity boost it would give me. Typing speed isn’t always my primary bottleneck. For example, while writing this paragraph I paused at least three times to work out the next sentence. Boosting my typing speed might mean I’d just sit in this idle state for longer. </p>

Dear Diecast
How come not a single one of the 24 spoiler warning games has been Japanese? I’m never gonna get a Deadly Premonition, Dragon’s Dogma or Metal Gear Rising Revengeance playthrough at this rate! Do I have to get Superbunnyhop on again to make this happen?

<p>I think that’s probably the most colons I’ve ever had on one line. Anyway, Josh played through the previous game before diving in to Mankind Divided, and has some thoughts on returning to the game after so many years have passed.</p>
<p>For those that missed it here’s our coverage of the original cut of the game on Spoiler Warning:</p>

Show notes:0:00:45: Mumbles gives her take on No Man’s Sky

Most of us talked about the game a couple of weeks ago, but now we get to hear what Mumbles thinks of it.

0:05:07: Zen Games

0:08:15: Mankind Divided




0:47:00: Looking Back: Josh discusses Deus Ex: Human Revolution: Director’s Cut

I think that’s probably the most colons I’ve ever had on one line. Anyway, Josh played through the previous game before diving in to Mankind Divided, and has some thoughts on returning to the game after so many years have passed.

For those that missed it here’s our coverage of the original cut of the game on Spoiler Warning:


This was the season where Campster joined the show. Time flies.

0:55:35: Harry Potter and the Cursed Child

THERE WILL BE TOTAL SPOILERS FOR ALL THINGS HARRY POTTER.

<strong>0:00:40: Looking ahead to the end of 2016.</strong></p>
<p>Looking back, it feels sort of like the <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=29624">Black Friday problem</a> I’ve talked about in the past. You want to release your games close to Christmas so that it’s there for gift-buyers. But then someone else does the same thing and you end up sharing the sales instead of dominating them. So you move the release date up a little bit to hit the shelves before them. But they get the same idea, and pretty soon everyone is fighting for October sales.</p>

<p><strong>0:05:55: Battlefield VS. Titanfall</strong></p>
<p><strong>0:11:19: Gears of War 4</strong></p>
<p>During the show I said I didn’t care about Gears of War. I’ve actually been curious about the series for a long time and now that it’s coming to PC I might actually check it out. Although, not at launch-day prices.</p>
<p><strong>0:14:42: Civilization 6</strong></p>
<p>I’m really looking forward to picking this up so I can be bad at it and play it wrong.</p>

<p><strong>0:23:54: Final Fantasy 15</strong></p>
<p><strong>0:27:05: Star Trek Bridge Crew</strong></p>
<p>I keep getting this confused with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Bridge_Commander">Star Trek Bridge Commander</a>, which is a totally different game.</p>

<p><strong>0:56:20: Human Revolution</strong></p>
<p>I am NOT looking forward to this game. I found the whole <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-08-03-deus-ex-augs-lives-matter-slogan-an-unfortunate-coincidence">AUGS LIVES MATTER controversy</a> to be really off-putting<span class="snote" title="1">AND ALSO GRAMMATICALLY INCORRECT. It should be “AUG LIVES MATTER”.</span>. Not because the topic is too taboo (or whatever) to appear in a videogame, but because it was so clumsy, on-the-nose, and heavy-handed about it. Sure, you COULD use this topic as a <em>great</em> starting point for a story, but I have zero faith that it will be handled with the thoughtful nuance it deserves. I fully expect to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launched out of the game by on-the-nose, immersion-breaking references to Current Events.
</li><li>Irritated if the game casts my viewpoint as the Bad Guys.
</li><li>Embarrassed if they cast my side as the Good Guys.
</li><li>Frustrated if they use a topic as decoration but refuse to actually define it or integrate it with the world. (Like synths in Fallout 4.)
</li></ol>
<p>So I’m actually pretty ambivalent about this game so far. This is on top of the other problems we discussed in this episode, that this series has lost its way.</p>
<p><a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=31891">I SHOULDN’T NEED TO SAY THIS BUT I WILL</a>: This is not the place to talk about Black Lives Matter. We can talk about hijacking existing controversy as a marketing ploy, or using current events as setting flavor, but let’s leave the particulars of BLM out of it. If you see someone go too far, please for my sake let it slide and let me handle it. I’ll do my best to keep this stress-free for all of us.</p>

Heads up: No Spoiler Warning this week. But! Josh and Chris are working on something fun that might hold us over.

I am NOT looking forward to this game. I found the whole AUGS LIVES MATTER controversy to be really off-puttingAND ALSO GRAMMATICALLY INCORRECT. It should be “AUG LIVES MATTER”.. Not because the topic is too taboo (or whatever) to appear in a videogame, but because it was so clumsy, on-the-nose, and heavy-handed about it.

<p>Thanks for the feedback last week. I know how I want to structure these posts so that the RSS feed works and is easy to find, and the built-in media player appears properly.

<p>Like I said in the show intro, I’m working on adding the podcast to Google Play and (eventually) to iTunes. While this is going on, the post will be a little wonky. (For example, as of right now there are two media players on this page, although if you’re reading this from the archives in the future then I’ve hopefully fixed it by now.) Please bear with us. <a href="https://play.google.com/music/listen#/ps/I26tzdf7n6acqbddz367qqjbopa">Here is the podcast on Google Play</a> and here is a link to the GP <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?feed=podcast">RSS feed</a>.</p>

<p><strong>1:00: We compare Chris to Strong Sad.</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t know anything about Homestar Runner, then this video probably won’t even begin to help you to have an inkling of an iota of a notion of what you’re missing. But it’s got Strong Sad in it, and that’s what’s important for the purposes of our discussion.</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>4:05: Diecast on Google Play and iTunes.</strong></p>
<p>To submit to Google Play / iTunes, you need a custom RSS feed with their company-specific special-snowflake tags added. Assuming you have better things to do than manually generate your own RSS feed (or write and maintain integrated WordPress plugins to do same) then this means using an existing WordPress plugin. The one I’m using is the best I found. (Read: Simplest to enable and roll out on an existing site. Most plugins seem to be written with the assumption that your blog BRAND NEW and ONLY for the podcast and thus everything should be added to the RSS feed.) But this one comes with its own player and problems and frustrations. </p>
<p>Anyway. If you’re a Google Play user then please let me know if it works like it should. If you have any advice for adding the show to iTunes without needing to install stupid iTunes on my PC, I’d love to hear it. If not, then it sounds like Mumbles can take care of it.</p>
<p>I’m asking this on the show because I don’t use RSS, I don’t listen to podcasts, I don’t use Google Play, and I don’t do very much with mobile devices, so there’s no way I’ll know if I’ve gotten it wrong.</p>
<p><strong>7:55: Star Trek Beyond</strong></p>
<p>Here’s the Twitter fit I threw last year when the first trailer came out, along with the trailer in question:</p>

<p>But like I said in some follow-up tweets, I’ve long since made peace with the fact that Trek movies are just action films now. I’m okay with that as long as they’re GOOD. (Which both Josh and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nfEprhrXGQ">Moviebob</a> say this one is.)</p>

If you don’t know anything about Homestar Runner, then this video probably won’t even begin to help you to have an inkling of an iota of a notion of what you’re missing. But it’s got Strong Sad in it, and that’s what’s important for the purposes of our discussion.




4:05: Diecast on Google Play and iTunes.

To submit to Google Play / iTunes, you need a custom RSS feed with their company-specific special-snowflake tags added. Assuming you have better things to do than manually generate your own RSS feed (or write and maintain integrated WordPress plugins to do same) then this means using an existing WordPress plugin.

Most plugins seem to be written with the assumption that your blog BRAND NEW and ONLY for the podcast and thus everything should be added to the RSS feed.) But this one comes with its own player and problems and frustrations. 

Anyway. If you’re a Google Play user then please let me know if it works like it should. If you have any advice for adding the show to iTunes without needing to install stupid iTunes on my PC, I’d love to hear it. If not, then it sounds like Mumbles can take care of it.

I’m asking this on the show because I don’t use RSS, I don’t listen to podcasts, I don’t use Google Play, and I don’t do very much with mobile devices, so there’s no way I’ll know if I’ve gotten it wrong.

7:55: Star Trek Beyond

Here’s the Twitter fit I threw last year when the first trailer came out, along with the trailer in question:

16:01 FTL has been updated and is more interesting now.

To clarify: The update is “new” in the sense of being new to me. It was actually released ages ago. (A couple of years, according to the comments.)

20:40 Josh goes on a rant about Adobe products and their bone-headed keymapping feature.

24:00 Scary games / Not Scary Games

33:19 Starbound




52:34 Mailbag: Rutskarn’s made-up internet name.

Dear Rutskarn,
What is the proper pronunciation of your name?  Your fellow casters call you Rut-skarn (or Butt-skarn) but when you introduce yourself when hosting you say Root-skarn.
Best Regards,
Jared
53:54 Mailbag: Details vs. Drama

Dear Shamus/Diecast, 
In your Mass Effect Retrospective, you discussed details-first vs drama-first storytelling. However, you only spoke of this topic within sci-fi settings. Is it possible to tell a details-first fantasy story?
Thank you,
Steven

<strong>0:01:22: Shamus played the anime dating sim <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/339800/">Huniepop</a></strong></p>
<p>Since I asked for recommendations, I guess I should make clear what I’m looking for in a Match-3 game: 1) Focus on planning ahead and setting up deliberate moves. 2) NO TIMER. I like working with a limited number of moves, but being allowed to consider those moves for as long as I like. 3) Ideally, there would be some sort of meta-game. 4) Preferably something without naked anime girls.</p>
<p>Also, this discusses quasi-pornography. I’d encourage everyone to be respectful. Remember that one person’s “tame cheesecake” is another person’s “sick filth”. We’re all coming from different backgrounds and cultures and have different expectations. This is one of those topics that seem to flip everyone’s jerk switch. Try not to be crappy to each other. </p>
<p>Also, I’d like to say how happy I am that I can use the phrase “naked anime girls” without worrying that the Google smut-bot is going to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10caMf8ZRX8">throw a fit</a>. </p>

39:14 The Room

This is talking about a puzzle game about opening doors and boxes, which sounds lame but actually looks really appealing. The game “The Room” has nothing to do with the developer “The Chinese Room”, although in one of our many nested tangents we manage to talk about exactly that…

49:00 The Chinese Room

We spend a lot of time talking about Dear Esther and the degree to which it did / didn’t work, and why. Here’s the analysis from Innuendo Studios that Chris mentioned.

1:05:03 VA-11 Hall-A




We start off talking about the game, but then move onto the more important topic of “If each of us was turned into a videogame, what would it be?”

Dear Diecast,
We often praise games for trying something new, but it doesn’t always work out. What is your favorite/most interesting failure of a game?

<p>I’ve watched some gameplay on YouTube since then, and it looks very different. It’s much more about gathering resources and weapons and less about having your head messed with.

<p>I apologize for this long, incoherent rant. This was the most frustrating game I’ve played in ages because it felt like it was close to greatness.

Show notes:
01:06 Hitman

It’s another name reboot. I’ll try not to freak out about it this time. Instead, here’s another link to Mark Brown talking about the new Hitman:




10:26 Uncharted 4
23:60 Buying video cards in 2016 is hard and stupid and I hate life.

It’s almost as bad as shopping for a toaster.

Dear Diecast,
What do you make of Valve’s recent announcement that they have teamed up with Lionsgate to bring films to Steam?   Do you think other film studios will follow suit?  Could Valve succeed in morfing Steam into a real iTunes competitor, and if so, would that upset gamers?
Cheers,

Have any of you tried the new survival mode for Fallout 4, if so, what are your thoughts?
-A
44:44 Mailbag: The Silmarillion  

Hello Diecast!
Shamus, you are the foremost expert on the Lord or The Rings, judging by how eloquently you analyze it as well as by how many copies of the book you have used up over the years.
Have you read any of the other Middle-Earth material, like the Silmarillion or the Short Stories? If so, how do they compare to the Hobbit and LOTR?
Regards,
Matthias
47:30 Mailbag: Violence

Dear Diecast,
What do you think of the fact that violence, usually killing and being killed, is the primary way the player interacts with the universe in most games, and do you think that has had any spillover effect on other media?  
I kept wondering about that after finally seeing the new Star Wars and being bugged by how many people the heroes kill onscreen, as opposed to being in far-off explosions or the camera cutting away before the killing blow, like what happens with most of the villains’ kills.  The amount of points where the protagonists are stuck in a place where they just have to kill everybody else in the area to proceed just felt like a videogame.
Sincerely, Michael.

Let’s pretend you have full creative control and that you accept the offer (though whether you would is also an interesting question). What do you make? To what degree do you play it safe or push the envelope? How do you allocate your resources?</p>

11:18 Fallout Mods.

It’s pretty hard to discuss the Fallout modding scene without slipping into yet another enumeration of the shortcomings of Fallout 4. We tried.

29:45 Mailbag: Sc-fi is sometimes hard.

Dear Dice Wizards,
Writers often create characters, species, or races lacking some essential part of what makes us human, ie. no emotions, sense of pain, fear of death, no body in the sense that we think of it, individuality, sexual desire, etc.
Since these characters often still tend to think and act like humans do, do you think writers and actors, as regular lifelong humans, are any good at imagining and portraying beings that lack important parts of what drives our thoughts and actions?

50:31 Mailbag: What would YOU do with an $80 million game budget?

A hypothetical AAA entity who likes The Diecast offers to put you (the collective crew of the Diecast) in charge of a AAA game with a budget of, let’s say, 80 million USD. Let’s pretend you have full creative control and that you accept the offer (though whether you would is also an interesting question). What do you make? To what degree do you play it safe or push the envelope? How do you allocate your resources?
Live long &amp; prosper,
Erich T. Wade
I have to give Erich credit for a well-constructed question. This setup anticipated all the ways in which we would attempt to weasel out of answering it.

1:00:50 Mailbag: EA Convention

A while back, Shamus and Josh were talking about how EA and somebody else weren’t having E3 booths any more because it wasn’t worth the expense for them. 
Rather than having a presence at a general game show like E3 or a PAX, do you think it would make sense for somebody like EA to run their own show, Blizzcon-style?

<p>Related to Wrasslin’, I saw this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYvMOf3hsGA">Wrestling isn’t Wrestling</a> by Max Landis, and I found it charming as hell.

<p>The video introduces the story-driven drama of wrestling by telling the 20-year history of Triple H. It tells the story with all of the wrestler genders flipped, which is fun and hilarious.

<p>Be on the lookout for other names that should be familiar, even if you don’t know anything about wrestling.

<p><strong>EDIT: Okay. That’s enough of this. Topic closed.</strong></p>
<p></p><table border="0" class="nomargin" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/images/dumpster_fire.gif?189db0&amp;189db0" class="imagefull" alt="For me, it's always like this." title="For me, it's always like this."></td></tr><tr><td class="insetcaptionx"><p class="mouseover_alt">For me, it's always like this.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
<p>Last week there was a bit of controversy <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=31309">on Spoiler Warning</a>. If you don’t watch the show or don’t read the comments then you probably won’t have the context for this. Basically, Mumbles made some jokes about torturing robots, some other people objected, and then Mumbles recorded this:</p>
<p>During the show, when she said she was sick of the female coach character, it hit on something I’d been thinking about for weeks, which was the series of design decisions that led to this trope. So as she commented on it, I reflexively went, “Oh, here’s a segue into that thing I’ve been thinking about!” So then I tried to talk about it on the spot, and halfway into it I realized it was too big and complicated to cover on the show<span class="snote" title="1">This actually happens pretty often. I should rename my column, “Random Shit That Didn’t Fit on Spoiler Warning.”</span>. I ended up turning it into <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=31376">my weekly column</a>. But then that dumped even more aggro on Mumbles. (Sorry Mumbles.)</p>
<p>Hopefully this clears everything up and puts the controversy to rest. This is supposed to be fun.</p>

      <itunes:summary>EDIT: Okay. That’s enough of this. Topic closed.


For me, it’s always like this.

Last week there was a bit of controversy on Spoiler Warning. If you don’t watch the show or don’t read the comments then you probably won’t have the context for this. Basically, Mumbles made some jokes about torturing robots, some other people objected, and then Mumbles recorded this:

During the show, when she said she was sick of the female coach character, it hit on something I’d been thinking about for weeks, which was the series of design decisions that led to this trope. So as she commented on it, I reflexively went, “Oh, here’s a segue into that thing I’ve been thinking about!” So then I tried to talk about it on the spot, and halfway into it I realized it was too big and complicated to cover on the showThis actually happens pretty often. I should rename my column, “Random Shit That Didn’t Fit on Spoiler Warning.”. I ended up turning it into my weekly column. But then that dumped even more aggro on Mumbles. (Sorry Mumbles.)

Hopefully this clears everything up and puts the controversy to rest. This is supposed to be fun.

<span id="more-31032"></span><strong>00:01:00 Microsoft and Windows 10 Store Shenanigans</strong></p>
<p>Here is Tim Sweeny, literally <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/04/microsoft-monopolise-pc-games-development-epic-games-gears-of-war">calling on people to fight the Microsoft initiative</a>. If there’s one critique I have for Sweeny, it’s that I think bringing up the Microsoft antitrust lawsuit is a mistake in this context. That case was really complex and doesn’t come off as the scathing condemnation he intends it to. If you’re trying to persuade an undecided audience to join your cause, doing so under a controversial banner only limits your reach. If you’re arguing tax policy, don’t try to bolster your argument with arguments that require the reader agree with you on (say) abortion. You’re just going to thread-jack your own argument, and people will debate the controversial thing instead of examining the new thing you’re trying to get them to care about. </p>
<p>For example, now that I’ve mentioned the antitrust suit, people are going to be tempted to bring it up here, so I need to head them off with this: <em>This is not about the [lack of?] merit of the antitrust lawsuit and if you try to argue about it here you are the debate equivalent of a cat chasing a laser pointer. Let’s keep the conversation focused on Microsoft’s shenanigans in 2016.</em></p>
<p>I think you can make a really good case against UWP on simple practical grounds as a consumer, and that doesn’t require agreement on the antitrust case, which was a debate that took thousands of different viewpoints and tried to shove them into simple boxes labeled “for” and “against”. </p>
<p>Also, since we mentioned Jill of the Jungle, I have to link to this. I fell in love with this game back in the day, despite the fact that I don’t really enjoy 2D sidescrolling platformers. This game won me over with presentation and soundtrack. (Mostly soundtrack.)</p>

Episode edited by Josh.<p></p>
<p>As we recorded this, Mumbles was getting over being sick. And while I didn’t know it at the time, I was just a few hours from becoming annoyingly sick myself. </p>
<p>Show notes: <span id="more-30875"></span></p>
<p><strong>00:02:00: Oxenfree</strong></p>
<p>Mild spoilers. Mumbles says somethign vague about the ending or whatever.<br>
</p><p></p>
<p>Here is <a href="http://digitalmumbles.com/2016/02/24/oxenfree-soundtrack/">the post Mumbles did about the Oxenfree soundtrack</a>.</p>
<p><strong>00:11:30: Devil Daggers</strong></p>
<p>I don’t think this trailer really sells the game all that well. It’s much more hectic than what you see here:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>Spoiler: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSoRbNs9bDk">Here is the video that ruined the game for me</a>. It’s someone playing for 8 minutes. Once I saw that, I kind of felt like my own one-minute scores were too sad to continue working on.</p>
<p><strong>00:19:30: Star Wars Novel: Lost Stars </strong></p>
<p>Here is <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25067046-star-wars">a link to the book on GoodReads</a>. </p>
<p><strong>00:24:45: X-Com 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>00:28:30: Josh got a mechanical keyboard.</strong></p>
<p>We compared keyboards in the diecast. For the record, here is mine in rainbow mode:</p>
<p></p><table border="0" class="nomargin" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/images/keyboard1.jpg?189db0&amp;189db0" class="imagefull" alt="I don't actually use rainbow mode. Boringly, I mostly stick to pure white." title="I don't actually use rainbow mode. Boringly, I mostly stick to pure white."></td></tr><tr><td class="insetcaptionx"><p class="mouseover_alt">I don't actually use rainbow mode. Boringly, I mostly stick to pure white.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
<p>You can also see the purple Halloween lights I have strung around under my desk, in case you thought I was kidding when I talked about that on Spoiler Warning.</p>
<p>I hate looking down at the keyboard and seeing crud, dust, and crumbs. My previous keyboard was black, and sometimes I’d have a massive OCD fit and tear the thing apart to clean all the gunk out. This keyboard doesn’t have a frame around it, which means it should be easier to clean. (If I blast it with compressed air, the debris will leave the device instead of going deeper in.</p>
<p><strong>00:34:15: Shamus goes on a strange digression about raging out.</strong></p>
<p>Sorry for interrupting Josh’s keyboard talk. I know this feels kind of out of place on the show. This is something I’ve wanted to write about for ages, but… didn’t. So then the subject came up and I couldn’t help talking about it.</p>
<p>If you suffer from fits of rage like I used to, I hope some of my rambling advice is helpful to you. Just remember: Your goal isn’t to stop being angry. That’s impossible and will actually only make things worse. Your goal should be getting the anger out in non-destructive ways. A good secondary goal is to experiment with your diet and medications and see if you can identify something that exacerbates the problem. </p>
<p>Thanks to the rest of the cast for humoring this digression.</p>

Episode edited by Josh.

As we recorded this, Mumbles was getting over being sick. And while I didn’t know it at the time, I was just a few hours from becoming annoyingly sick myself. 

Show notes: 

00:02:00: Oxenfree

Mild spoilers. Mumbles says somethign vague about the ending or whatever.



Here is the post Mumbles did about the Oxenfree soundtrack.

00:11:30: Devil Daggers

I don’t think this trailer really sells the game all that well. It’s much more hectic than what you see here:




Spoiler: Here is the video that ruined the game for me. It’s someone playing for 8 minutes. Once I saw that, I kind of felt like my own one-minute scores were too sad to continue working on.

00:19:30: Star Wars Novel: Lost Stars 

Here is a link to the book on GoodReads. 

00:24:45: X-Com 2

00:28:30: Josh got a mechanical keyboard.

We compared keyboards in the diecast. For the record, here is mine in rainbow mode:


I don’t actually use rainbow mode. Boringly, I mostly stick to pure white.

You can also see the purple Halloween lights I have strung around under my desk, in case you thought I was kidding when I talked about that on Spoiler Warning.

I hate looking down at the keyboard and seeing crud, dust, and crumbs. My previous keyboard was black, and sometimes I’d have a massive OCD fit and tear the thing apart to clean all the gunk out. This keyboard doesn’t have a frame around it, which means it should be easier to clean. (If I blast it with compressed air, the debris will leave the device instead of going deeper in.

00:34:15: Shamus goes on a strange digression about raging out.

Sorry for interrupting Josh’s keyboard talk. I know this feels kind of out of place on the show. This is something I’ve wanted to write about for ages, but… didn’t. So then the subject came up and I couldn’t help talking about it.

If you suffer from fits of rage like I used to, I hope some of my rambling advice is helpful to you. Just remember: Your goal isn’t to stop being angry. That’s impossible and will actually only make things worse. Your goal should be getting the anger out in non-destructive ways. A good secondary goal is to experiment with your diet and medications and see if you can identify something that exacerbates the problem. 

Thanks to the rest of the cast for humoring this digression.

00:40:30: SUPER HOT




00:50:00: Good Trends


@Rutskarn People talk a lot about bad trends in video games; what recent trends in video games do you want to see more of?

00:38:42: Do bad games make good games better?

Dear Diecast,
So I have actually kinda cathartically enjoyed a couple different critiques on Bethesda’s Fallout 4. Its a really fun problem to have, since the issues Bethesda has introduced seem to be based on huge misunderstanding of the franchise. But in a way it also does shine a light on the games that did understand its franchise right, and thats what I wanted to know about. Do franchises benefit from having a few bad apples, in order to make the other works feel more special. Is that why we cherish New Vegas as a return to form? Are there any other franchises that have benefitted from having bad works? I think Star Wars could be one.
Questionably,
James
00:49:02: Extemporaneous self-insert surprise question!

Dear Diecast,
Can you think of any games that broke from their old style and were just as good (or better for it) after being re-invented.

<p><strong>0:00:50: Defense Grid 2</strong> </p>
<p>Protip: You can turn the dialog volume all the way down and play this as a plotless tower defense game. I feel bad about doing so, but <em>damn</em> does that dialog drag on.</p>
<p><strong>0:13:05: Naval Action</strong></p>
<p><strong>0:19:50: Rainbow  Six Siege</strong></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>0:27:05: Rise Of The Tomb Raider</strong></p>
<p>It’s not that the story sucks, it’s that it gets too much focus. These mechanics are really strong, and I think the game should be more confident about leaving us to enjoy them for longer. Also, like I said the other day:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">

<p>Having played a few more hours now, I’m pretty sure it’s a magical glowstick that turns itself off if there are dudes in the zone. It’s still bananas, but it’s a different kind of bananas than I first assumed.</p>
<p><strong>0:44:18: The Witness</strong></p>
<p><strong>0:54:06: EA is “on a Journey” to Regain PC Gamer Trust</strong> </p>
<p>My column this week is also on this topic. But I’m sure you guessed that already.</p>

Show notes: 

0:00:50: Defense Grid 2 

Protip: You can turn the dialog volume all the way down and play this as a plotless tower defense game. I feel bad about doing so, but damn does that dialog drag on.

0:13:05: Naval Action

0:19:50: Rainbow  Six Siege




0:27:05: Rise Of The Tomb Raider

It’s not that the story sucks, it’s that it gets too much focus. These mechanics are really strong, and I think the game should be more confident about leaving us to enjoy them for longer. Also, like I said the other day:


Dev who designed these stealth sections should have touched base with dev who decided player would wear a glowstick. pic.twitter.com/AcyzfzZMDf
— Shamus Young (@shamusyoung) January 30, 2016

Having played a few more hours now, I’m pretty sure it’s a magical glowstick that turns itself off if there are dudes in the zone. It’s still bananas, but it’s a different kind of bananas than I first assumed.

0:44:18: The Witness

0:54:06: EA is “on a Journey” to Regain PC Gamer Trust 

My column this week is also on this topic. But I’m sure you guessed that already.

<p>Is this the first time Mumbles has hosted? I think it is! And I wasn’t there to see it.</p>
<p>Since I wasn’t in the show, I put my thoughts in the show notes below.</p>
<p>Show notes:<span id="more-30199"></span><br>
<strong>1:00: Powerball</strong></p>
<p>For the curious: I’ve never bought a lottery ticket of any kind in my whole life. Having said that, I’m not one of those people who likes to mock people for playing the lottery. It’s just that my gambling takes a different form. Instead of wasting a couple of dollars for an <em>extremely</em> astronomical chance at success, I risk hundreds or thousands of hours of my life on projects (books, comics, game development) for a <em>mildly</em> astronomical chance at success. Who is the bigger dumbass? I don’t think it’s that clear-cut. </p>
<p>And like a lottery player, I don’t play because I expect to win. I play because I enjoy the experience of playing. Although now that I have <a href="https://www.patreon.com/shamusyoung?ty=h">Patreon</a> it feels less like a random gamble and more like a sane investment. </p>
<p>So, thanks, by the way. </p>
<p><strong>3:08: Oculus Rift</strong></p>
<p>My column this week will discuss this.</p>
<p><strong>21:35: Amplitude</strong></p>
<p>It’s only recently that I became aware of how horrible I am at multi-tasking. I can’t listen and do something at the same time. If I’m playing a game, I have to pause. Earlier in our marriage I overestimated my multitasking capacity. I’d try to listen and play at the same time, and end up doing that “half listening” thing. Something like:</p>
<p>Heather: I’m going to the store. I left a cake in the oven. Can you take it out in twenty minutes?</p>
<p>Me: (Pause for several seconds, staring fixedly at the screen.) Yeah. Cake. Twenty minutes.</p>
<p>And then later she comes home and the cake is a brick of carbon. She asks me about it, and I barely remember the earlier conversation at all.</p>
<p>This is why I don’t stream, even though that would be a fun thing to do. A Shamus Twitch Stream would just be me playing, mostly in silence. Once in  a while I’d say something like, “I like fighting these…. shit. (pause.) These skeleton guys are interesting bec- shit. Hang on. (Five minutes of silence.) So anyway… the… skeleton guys… are very… interesting because… <em>Oh shit that was a lot of XP.</em> because… they… the skeletons, I mean… they’re interesting when you… aw damn it!  When you have, like… When you’re fighting them but you also…”</p>
<p>Yeah. It wouldn’t be entertaining. I actually have to concentrate really hard when I listen and speak, which probably explains why my social development <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=12853">lagged so far behind other kids</a>.</p>

Obviously we don’t want to be seriously concerned about, say, Mario’s wellbeing when he touches a goomba, but in the endless supply of World War 2 shooters, the voice acting is suprisingly lacking.

No Star Wars talk this week. It’s a little too soon. But I suspect next week will be the big spoiler discussion. Be ready!

Show notes: 

00:00:45: Disney Land vs. Disney World

Mumbles went on her honeymoon last week, and she went to Disney Land / World. I said I didn’t know the difference. So she explained. 

I still don’t know the difference. She tried.

00:29:51: Voice acting and realism

Dear Diecast:
Though Dark Souls is known for being hard, it is also known for its aesthetic. One aspect where I really appreciated the attention to detail was in the voice acting for the player character: In most games, when the player character gets hurt, you hear a fairly unbelieveable “ouch” or “oof” just to alert you, but Dark Souls makes it sound like your character is really in pain! (Particularly if you choose a female character)
Do you think other games are as deliberate about not doing what Dark Souls is deliberate about doing? Obviously we don’t want to be seriously concerned about, say, Mario’s wellbeing when he touches a goomba, but in the endless supply of World War 2 shooters, the voice acting is suprisingly lacking. Is this an example of most games failing to be realistic, or an example where we really shouldn’t have realism as a goal?

<p>Whoops. Rachel left about four minutes of dead air on the tail end of the podcast. In her defense, she edited the show while sick, and her computer crashed and forced her to start over at the halfway point. I figured it was better to let it slide than to wake her up and make her re-encode the whole thing. You understand.</p>
<p>Show notes:<span id="more-29408"></span></p>
<p><strong>00:00:34: Rise of The Tomb R-<i>HEY EVERYONE FALLOUT 4 IS OUT!</i></strong></p>
<p>I’d like to temper my commentary on the game a little. Yesterday on Twitter I said:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Woo. Just beat <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fallout4?src=hash">#Fallout4</a>!

It's the best bits of New Vegas, with the best bits of Skyrim. My new favorite in… whatever we call this genre.</p>
<p>— Shamus Young (@shamusyoung) <a href="https://twitter.com/shamusyoung/status/665886629479993344">November 15, 2015</a></p></blockquote>

<p>I think rather than being the “best of both games”, it’s more like we finally got a game that avoids the crippling <em>failures</em> of both. It might sound like I’m splitting hairs, but bear with me. I think this is an important distinction.</p>
<p>Fallout 4 gets pretty schlocky in parts, but it’s not the brain-melting idiocy of Fallout 3. The plot is more engaging than the battle against time-traveling dragons that somehow managed to come off as dull in Skyrim. It’s a little rough around the edges like all Gamebryo games, but it’s not nearly as buggy as New Vegas. </p>
<p>So I shouldn’t have implied this is the <em>best</em> of the bunch. More like it’s the one with the <em>least severe flaws</em>. The whole product seems to be converging on a point of adequacy. </p>
<p>So. Yeah. Don’t run out and buy it because Shamus promised you story better than New Vegas. </p>

Hosts: Josh, Shamus, Mumbles. Episode edited by Rachel.

Whoops. Rachel left about four minutes of dead air on the tail end of the podcast. In her defense, she edited the show while sick, and her computer crashed and forced her to start over at the halfway point. I figured it was better to let it slide than to wake her up and make her re-encode the whole thing. You understand.

Show notes:

00:00:34: Rise of The Tomb R-HEY EVERYONE FALLOUT 4 IS OUT!

I’d like to temper my commentary on the game a little. Yesterday on Twitter I said:


Woo. Just beat #Fallout4!

It’s the best bits of New Vegas, with the best bits of Skyrim. My new favorite in… whatever we call this genre.
— Shamus Young (@shamusyoung) November 15, 2015

I think rather than being the “best of both games”, it’s more like we finally got a game that avoids the crippling failures of both. It might sound like I’m splitting hairs, but bear with me. I think this is an important distinction.

Fallout 4 gets pretty schlocky in parts, but it’s not the brain-melting idiocy of Fallout 3. The plot is more engaging than the battle against time-traveling dragons that somehow managed to come off as dull in Skyrim. It’s a little rough around the edges like all Gamebryo games, but it’s not nearly as buggy as New Vegas. 

So I shouldn’t have implied this is the best of the bunch. More like it’s the one with the least severe flaws. The whole product seems to be converging on a point of adequacy. 

So. Yeah. Don’t run out and buy it because Shamus promised you story better than New Vegas. 

00:04:30: Fallout 4 Game Engine tied to framerate.

The video I mentioned:




00:07:44: Rise of the Tomb Raider

Poor Crystal Dynamics. We’ll catch up with them once the game comes out for real.

00:12:50: Fallout 4 again. For basically the rest of the show.




00:32:00: Fallout 4 will probably be the next season of Spoiler Warning.

I know we usually give a game a year, but unless there’s a huge backlash Fallout 4 will happen in just a couple of months.

<p>Hope you had a fun Halloween. Here is an hour of us talking about videogames. </p>

<p>My column on this will go up later today.</p>

<p></p><p></p>
<p>Oof. Right in the feels. </p>
<p><strong>00:40:05 Tomb Raider releases on Tuesday.</strong></p>
<p>Opposite Fallout 4. And Starcraft: Legacy of the Void. And the latest Call of Duty. And it’s a platform exclusive. To the Xbox.</p>
<p>Sigh. I guess we’ll see how it turned out in a year.</p>
<p><strong>00:57:29 Bob Ross and the joy of positive content on the internet.</strong></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>I actually worry a lot about negativity. I don’t want to be known as That One Guy Who Hates Everything. Also, red-faced nerdrage attracts a more… energetic audience. While stuff like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFD2293oGvA">MovieBob’s ten-minute evisceration of Pixels</a> is insanely popular, it’s not the kind of thing I’d want to be known for. I actually think it would be bad for my outlook on life. While the initial salvo might be cathartic, I imaging there’s a pretty strong feedback loop going on that would make it miserable to produce that kind of content over the long haul. </p>
<p>But on the other hand, it’s pretty hard to have an all-positive show all the time. I have no idea how to make one. Explaining why something doesn’t work is usually a lot more complex than explaining why it does, so negative topics are usually more interesting. The Activision topic is a good example. If Activision did something ordinary and financially sound, then what would be the point of discussing it? Why bring it up? This isn’t a news show, it’s a commentary show. </p>
<p>What I’m getting at is: I love positive content and upbeat personalities. If given the choice, that’s the kind of space I’d prefer to occupy. But the engineer in me wants to troubleshoot problems. This site is basically the balance between those two opposing forces. </p>

Dear Diecast,
Nintendo recently filed a patent for a game console without a disk drive.  While that certainly isn’t the same as officially announcing such a console it still seems like big news.  Thoughts?

39:15 Mailbag: Fun ammo!

Dear Diecast,
Limited ammunition is one of the most common mechanics in video games, but it’s never seemed that interesting to me.  It’s only ever used to gate off certain weapons from use by not providing ammo for them, or to provide tension when the player has very little ammo left, but if you ever run out of all your ammo, then you just can’t play anymore.  Ammo seems to be at most just a hindrance to having fun.
My question is, are there any games that make ammo fun, if not, is there a way to make ammo a fun mechanic, or should ammo go the way of health in modern shooters, and just regenerate over time?

<strong>00:46 Human Resource Machine.</strong></p>
<p>Update: On the show I said I wanted to see how a non-coder would take to this game. I got it for <a href="http://www.blueberrystarstudio.com/">Rachel</a> last night, and she’s plowing through it. So it’s totally playable for people who have never coded before. Although now that I think of it, Rachel has done fairly extensive work with Minecraft command blocks, which probably gave her a good starting framework. Still, I think I can recommend this game unconditionally for both coders and non-coders. Which is pretty amazing. </p>
<p>I’ll probably have a follow-up post on this at some point to ask what people thought of it. </p>
<p><strong>13:02 Left-handed people and video games.</strong></p>

Although now that I think of it, Rachel has done fairly extensive work with Minecraft command blocks, which probably gave her a good starting framework. Still, I think I can recommend this game unconditionally for both coders and non-coders. Which is pretty amazing. 

I’ll probably have a follow-up post on this at some point to ask what people thought of it. 

13:02 Left-handed people and video games.

Fun trivia: The Diecast is 40% left-handers. (Mumbles and Chris.)

25:46 Mass Effect 3: Citadel DLC.

Also we talk about Frank Miller for reasons that will only make sense in retrospect.

Episode edited by <a href="http://www.blueberrystarstudio.com/">Rachel</a>.<p></p>
<p>Reader Jared recently went through the Diecast archives – all 119 episodes – and noted who was there and who hosted. This resulted in some interesting trivia:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shamus has attended 116 episodes and hosted 49 episodes.<br>
Josh has attended 117 episodes, partially attended 1 episode, and hosted 31 episodes.<br>
Chris has attended 108 episodes, hosted 7 episodes, and partially hosted 1 episode.<br>
Rutskarn has attended 75 episodes, partially attended 5 episodes, hosted 30 episodes, and partially hosted 1 episode.<br>
Mumbles has attended 44 episodes, partially attended 1 episode, and partially hosted 2 episodes.<br>
Jarenth has attended 10 episodes.<br>
SuperBunnyHop has attended 3 episodes.<br>
Krellin and PushingUpRoses have both attended 2 episodes.<br>
Arvind, Randy, and Glitch have each been in 1 episode.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks to Jared for putting that together.</p>

<strong>2:04: Deus Ex: Mankind Divided has ironically united us over the <a href="https://www.deusex.com/agegate?goto=/augmentyourpreorder">preorder deal</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Here is the trailer:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>13:42: Shamus talks about Narcos, a Netflix series about Pablo Escobar.</strong></p>
<p>I might have over-sold the “historical accuracy” angle a bit too much. Compared to a typical Hollywood movie, it’s amazingly faithful. But it’s clear artistic license was taken in parts. But in the broad strokes, the major events are all as true as the Wikipedia pages that describe them. Also, there are a lot of little strange details that feel like they must be true, simply because they are so odd<span class="snote" title="1">Spoiler: The DEA agent finds a newly-orphaned baby at a crime scene, takes it home and keeps it. It’s so random and unexpected, and not part of some overarching “boy I wish we could have a baby” plotline with his wife. If it was just added for drama, the writer probably would have tried to make it more dramatic and less perfunctory.</span>.</p>
<p><strong>21:47: Josh talks about the Stargate franchise.</strong></p>
<p><strong>27:25: The Hitman Movie, and also the Hitman games because of course we bring those up.</strong></p>

      <itunes:summary>Hosts: Shamus, Josh, Rudeskarn, Campster. Episode edited by Rachel.

Reader Jared recently went through the Diecast archives – all 119 episodes – and noted who was there and who hosted. This resulted in some interesting trivia:

Shamus has attended 116 episodes and hosted 49 episodes.
Josh has attended 117 episodes, partially attended 1 episode, and hosted 31 episodes.
Chris has attended 108 episodes, hosted 7 episodes, and partially hosted 1 episode.
Rutskarn has attended 75 episodes, partially attended 5 episodes, hosted 30 episodes, and partially hosted 1 episode.
Mumbles has attended 44 episodes, partially attended 1 episode, and partially hosted 2 episodes.
Jarenth has attended 10 episodes.
SuperBunnyHop has attended 3 episodes.
Krellin and PushingUpRoses have both attended 2 episodes.
Arvind, Randy, and Glitch have each been in 1 episode.

Thanks to Jared for putting that together.

Show notes:

2:04: Deus Ex: Mankind Divided has ironically united us over the preorder deal.

Here is the trailer:




13:42: Shamus talks about Narcos, a Netflix series about Pablo Escobar.

I might have over-sold the “historical accuracy” angle a bit too much. Compared to a typical Hollywood movie, it’s amazingly faithful. But it’s clear artistic license was taken in parts. But in the broad strokes, the major events are all as true as the Wikipedia pages that describe them. Also, there are a lot of little strange details that feel like they must be true, simply because they are so oddSpoiler: The DEA agent finds a newly-orphaned baby at a crime scene, takes it home and keeps it. It’s so random and unexpected, and not part of some overarching “boy I wish we could have a baby” plotline with his wife. If it was just added for drama, the writer probably would have tried to make it more dramatic and less perfunctory..

21:47: Josh talks about the Stargate franchise.

27:25: The Hitman Movie, and also the Hitman games because of course we bring those up.

42:33 Mad Max and Train Hats.

Here is an overview of how the Fallout 3 ride-able train is actually a hat worn by an NPC below the tracks and no that’s not a joke.

<p>Did you have trouble getting the Diecast to work with your RSS feed last week? I mistakenly had the download link pointed at “diecast117”, when it should have linked to “diecast117<strong>.mp3</strong>“. I noticed the problem a day later, and “fixed” it by changing the link to “diecast1<strong>7</strong>7.mp3″. I didn’t notice <em>that</em> blunder until Sunday when I write this post.</p>
<p>So, that was a pretty comprehensive failure on my part. Should be fixed now. Or maybe not. I’m probably not the most reliable person to ask, to be honest. But as far as I know, it should all work.</p>

      <title>Rutskarn’s RPG Tales: Paranoia (Full Session Recording)</title>
      <link>http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=28177</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p></p>
<p>Hey, everyone, it’s Rutskarn. I don’t know if you’ve been keeping up with your farmer’s almanac, but the Time of Terror and Blood was recently upon us, and the Great Beast you know as Josh was briefly trapped inside the Southern California ley line. I took advantage of his psychic imprisonment to schedule an ad hoc game of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoia_(role-playing_game)">Paranoia</a>.</em> Unfortunately for you, I recorded it.</p>
<p>Also starring: Josh’s brother Glitch, Glitch’s fiancee Madison.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this session was planned, run, recorded, and in some capacity edited on the fly. I didn’t even know we’d be playing <em>Paranoia</em> when I arrived (I brought a suitcase and flash drive that contained about fifteen separate systems and let them decide). Despite that, we had a lot of fun, and hopefully you will too. I’ve cleaned the audio as best as I could and trimmed a few breaks, but I’ll warn you up front–it’s far from perfect. The Hellish winds that follow Josh like ashen cherubs have that effect on a recording suite.</p>
<p>(Note also that anyone who illustrates anything that happened in this session will earn my undying love.)</p>
<p>And below the fold, all notes and secret information that passed this session:</p>
<p><span id="more-28177"></span><br>
<strong>Josh </strong>had the mutant power to phase through solid objects when he gave a signal. He was part of a secret society that wanted to gain as much information as possible about the plant. They planted a camera for him in a can of Bouncy Bubble Beverage. <strong>Glitch </strong>had the mutant power to turn invisible. He was part of a secret society that suspected someone was trying to sabotage the plant. He’d know who the saboteur was because they were acting suspicious, wandering into restricted areas, and recovering classified information. <strong>Madison </strong>had the mutant power to read notes passed.

      <itunes:summary>Hey, everyone, it’s Rutskarn. I don’t know if you’ve been keeping up with your farmer’s almanac, but the Time of Terror and Blood was recently upon us, and the Great Beast you know as Josh was briefly trapped inside the Southern California ley line. I took advantage of his psychic imprisonment to schedule an ad hoc game of Paranoia. Unfortunately for you, I recorded it.

Also starring: Josh’s brother Glitch, Glitch’s fiancee Madison.

Keep in mind that this session was planned, run, recorded, and in some capacity edited on the fly. I didn’t even know we’d be playing Paranoia when I arrived (I brought a suitcase and flash drive that contained about fifteen separate systems and let them decide). Despite that, we had a lot of fun, and hopefully you will too. I’ve cleaned the audio as best as I could and trimmed a few breaks, but I’ll warn you up front–it’s far from perfect. The Hellish winds that follow Josh like ashen cherubs have that effect on a recording suite.

(Note also that anyone who illustrates anything that happened in this session will earn my undying love.)

And below the fold, all notes and secret information that passed this session:


Josh had the mutant power to phase through solid objects when he gave a signal. He was part of a secret society that wanted to gain as much information as possible about the plant. They planted a camera for him in a can of Bouncy Bubble Beverage. Glitch had the mutant power to turn invisible. He was part of a secret society that suspected someone was trying to sabotage the plant. He’d know who the saboteur was because they were acting suspicious, wandering into restricted areas, and recovering classified information. Madison had the mutant power to read notes passed. She was part of a secret society that wanted her to become as irradiated as possible without actually dying. How irradiated is that? Left to her discretion.

And now, the notes. Highlight to declassify:

NOTE 1: MADISON, YOU ARE FIELD-PROMOTED TO LOYALTY OFFICER. KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR MUTANTS AND TRAITORS.

NOTE 2: JOSH, YOU FOUND YOUR CAMERA

NOTE 3: FROM JOSH TO RUTSKARN: I AM USING THE CAMERA CONSPICUOUSLY

NOTE 4: GLITCH, YOU HAVE TURNED INVISIBLE

NOTE 5: JOSH, YOU HAVE PHASED INTO THE BASEMENT.

NOTE 6: JOSH, YOU SEE A CONSOLE. YOU THINK YOU CAN SHUT DOWN THE MELTDOWN FROM HERE.

NOTE 7: FROM JOSH TO RUTSKARN: I TAKE PICTURES OF THE CONSOLE, THEN LEAVE.

NOTE 8: THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY MUTANTS.

NOTE ??? YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO READ THIS NOTE, CITIZEN. PLEASE REPORT TO NEAREST CONFESSION BOOTH TO PROVIDE A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF WHY YOU THOUGHT THIS INFORMATION WAS MISSION-CRITICAL BE PREPARED TO PROVIDE PROOF OF ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE (REQUIRED TO HIGHLIGHT WHITE TEXT).

<p>The added challenge of romance specifically in video games is that every player has unique preferences, so you can’t just make a character “likeable” and call it day.

If the protagonist hooks up with someone whom the player is not attracted to, it can feel like an uncomfortable forcing of the hand, even worse for the fact that it puts romance, sex, and “forcing” in the same context.</p>

<p><strong>32:00 Games harmed by additional content.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast Mailbag Black Hole:</p>
<p>Some games frequently receive major post-release content updates, while with others you’re lucky to get a patch for critical bugs. In some cases the updates can change the nature of the original game quite a lot.

how do you think the B:AK launch fiasco would have played out if WB had released the game in it’s current state, *but* at reduced price and clearly labeled as a beta/early access version? That way, people who can run it sufficiently well could already play it, but it would have been clear that the game is far from optimized. I guess you would still get anger from people wanting to play the final version *right now*, and wondering why the consoles get it early.. but at least you would know what you’re getting.

Dear Diecast
What are your thoughts on Tacoma, the new game from Fullbright (creators of Gone Home). Do you think the simple walking and examining mechanics can support a larger scale game?
~Ben

32:00 Games harmed by additional content.

Dear Diecast Mailbag Black Hole:
Some games frequently receive major post-release content updates, while with others you’re lucky to get a patch for critical bugs. In some cases the updates can change the nature of the original game quite a lot. Have you ever been turned off a game because an update changed something you liked, or only gained interest in a game after new content was added?
-Neko
40:00 Participating anonymously. 

Have any of you participated in your own comment sections or forums under alternate pseudonyms? If so, why? I can think of a number of good reasons but I’m curious to hear your experiences. Or those of others in the biz that you know (this may be a good one to reserve for the next time you have a guest).
Sincerely
Frank Stallone
50:00 Square Enix has plans for Hitman.

Dear Diecast,
Following its announcement at E3, Square Enix has released some details concerning a rather unusual release plan for the new Hitman game. Namely, they plan to release some of the game on December 8th, and continually add to it across 2016.
https://hitman.com/news/announcing-hitman#
https://hitman.com/en-us/news/hitman-q-a#
Do you think this is a good sign for the game’s development, and do you think other AAA Developers may follow this release model?
Yours, Merzendi
At some point in the show (I forget where) I mentioned the graphical glitches I found in Shadow of Mordor. In case you’re curious:


Is this Elven magic or do I need to reboot?


TASTE THE RAINBOW. FIGHT THE RAINBOW.

You can’t see because of the ridiculous bloom lighting, but eventually the rainbow engulfed an entire stronghold. I’m up here on the rooftops, looking down into what should be a city. 


The graphical glitches I can forgive. But the juvenile debasement of Tolkien lore? Not so much.

<p>The problem with “artist renderings” of celestial bodies is that it’s not black-and-white, but a slippery slope.

The original pictures are often comprised of infra-red data, or some other non-visible wavelength. So you have to “re-color” them if you want them to be visible. And so you have some freedom to make aesthetic decisions: “What colors should I use to represent this data?” And from there you can combine two different images – perhaps one is IR data and another is x-rays, and you color each spectrum and then combine them to make these gorgeous composites with lots of color. And you can do some kind of HDR effect to get a huge range of intensity values that will fit in a standard image. Every change makes the data more beautiful and easier to visualize, but also makes it a little less “real” in terms of “what space actually looks like”.  </p>
<p>There’s a gradient of fidelity with “here is the raw telescope output, good luck making sense of it” on one end, and “we think the planet has a lot of ice so we hired an artist to draw Hoth” on the other. </p>

<p>Here’s a thought experiment: WB plans to sell these crappy Batmobile statues by making them part of the $200 collector’s edition. They plan a run of N thousand statues. There’s a certain overhead to selling mass-produced crap like this, so you need to sell in volume if you want to make money. Then let’s imagine that when the pre-orders roll in, instead of thousands of people ordering the Batmobile edition, they only got a few hundred. There’s no way they can sell just a few hundred of these without losing a ton of money. </p>
<p>If you’re an executive at WB, what do you do? If you’re an idiot you can tell the truth and admit your product is far less popular than you anticipated, and you can piss off fans by going back on the implied promise of a pre-order. You look bad, your product looks bad, and your customers are pissed. Alternatively, you can claim that there are “quality control issues”. This makes it sound like it’s not your fault at all. It’s not you, it’s that crappy factory in China! They made sub-standard products, and you have heroically decided to give up all those sweet pre-orders rather than sell your customers a sub-standard Batmobile.</p>
<p>I want to stress that this a made-up scenario on my part. But my point is that the “quality control” line is the best answer they could possibly give.

Heads up: No Spoiler Warning this week, but we’re going to try and post the archive of our E3 livestream.

Show notes:
0:30 Arkham Knight PC release was so bad the the publisher pulled it from shelves.

“Pulled it from shelves”? Pfft. As if they have shelf space for PC games at Gamestop. What is this, 1998?

Josh mentions the story about the $200 Batmobile Edition of the game, which was canceled due to “quality control” issues.

Here’s a thought experiment: WB plans to sell these crappy Batmobile statues by making them part of the $200 collector’s edition. They plan a run of N thousand statues. There’s a certain overhead to selling mass-produced crap like this, so you need to sell in volume if you want to make money. Then let’s imagine that when the pre-orders roll in, instead of thousands of people ordering the Batmobile edition, they only got a few hundred. There’s no way they can sell just a few hundred of these without losing a ton of money. 

If you’re an executive at WB, what do you do? If you’re an idiot you can tell the truth and admit your product is far less popular than you anticipated, and you can piss off fans by going back on the implied promise of a pre-order. You look bad, your product looks bad, and your customers are pissed. Alternatively, you can claim that there are “quality control issues”. This makes it sound like it’s not your fault at all.

This answer might be the truth, but it’s also suspiciously the most perfect and expedient deflection of blame they could have offered. I can’t prove – or even seriously allege – anything, but I do find myself looking a this very cynically.

Two hundred dollars is a lot of money.

19:00 Chris talks about Amibos.

28:00 GRAPHIX CARDZ!

Josh and Shamus are both upgrading, so it’s time for the biannual rant about the ongoing war between NVIDIA and AMD.

45:00 MAILTIME!

Dood!  Bruh…
BRUH!
WHAR MAH ERRANT SIGZ AT SON?!  Been like, what…oh, just two weeks.  Nevermind then.

It’s common practice, when inventing made-up peoples and cultures, to draw from real history and existing establishments. What games do you see as having done this the best? Which have done this the worst? Why?

        <![CDATA[<p>It’s a mailbag this week! I think we answered around 33% of the questions. I’m starting to think we need to do this more often. Once again, I’ve wiped the slate clean so if your question didn’t make it, it’s time to re-word or re-send if you’re still looking for an answer.</p>
<p>Another week, another apology for wonky audio. I’m really frustrated now because I have the right tools but I keep making dumb newbie mistakes. This week I left a fan on. Not one of those “whisper quiet” fans. And this thing wasn’t sitting across the room from me. This was a roaring box fan, right at my feet. Why? <em>Why did I not turn off the fan</em>?</p>
<p><a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=26779">Audio editing</a> got rid of the worst of it, but the ghost of the sound is still there when I talk.

23:00 Next Gen.

Dear Diecast
My Question is about “Next Gen”.
So we all know what next generation graphics are going to look like, peers out of the window and sighs.
What does everyone think next generation mechanics should look/play like?
Examples:
If we have “twice the power” of the previous gen, can we render 2 of the previous gen games at once to do strange overlapping levels?
Less polygons more fluid animations?
Being able to create more complex AI or Simulations?
Or just the ability to never have to see a loading screen ever again.

Dear Diecast
What makes you able to play and enjoy the Witcher 3 or Skyrim, but makes you get stuck in the Hinterlands in Inquisition for hours?

45:00 Books that expand on the lore of a game.

Deer Diecast.
Catching up on the Witcher games and watching the hangout, I noticed how the games make inevitable callbacks to the books.
My question is, what do you think about books that expand on the lore of a videogame? (lumping together videogames based on books and vice versa as well as books accompanying games).
Also if Josh could tell us real quick if the books are worthwile for fans of the witcher games.
Yours,
Ben
This is the SuperBunnyHop that Chris mentioned:

Dear Casters of all things Pod,

<strong>2:00 Mumbles is reading Batman: Endgame.</strong></p>
<p>CORRECTION: During the conversation I mention a “Think Geek” Loot Crate, but I’m pretty sure <a href="https://www.lootcrate.com/">Loot Crate</a> isn’t affiliated with Think Geek. The deal is that for a small monthly fee (around $12-ish) you get a box of random geek crap supposedly worth $40. I’m sure it’s just overstock stuff some other outfit is trying to unload quickly. It’s the online equivalent of a bargain bin. But it’s also strangely fun. We got it for my son on his birthday, and getting our monthly loot crate is a big deal around here. Everyone gathers around to see what bits of random fandom we got this month. </p>
<p><strong>20:00 Mumbles recommends Lost Constellation.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://finji.itch.io/lost-constellation">You can get it from the official site</a> and is offered on a “name your own price” basis.</p>
<p><strong>22:00 Chris is playing “You Don’t Know Jack”.</strong></p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZcX_ZdlW3Q">the new Errant Signal is out! It’s about GTA V</a>. </p>
<p><strong>28:00 Josh is playing roguelikes.</strong> </p>
<p><a href="http://te4.org/wiki/Tales_of_Maj%27Eyal_Wiki">Tome</a>  </p>
<p><strong>34:00 Shamus isn’t playing much of the videogames.</strong></p>
<p>Instead I’m writing my end-of-year stuff and watching speed runs. Here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SpeedDemosArchiveSDA">Awesome Games Done Quick</a>. But really, I’m a sucker for any Deus Ex or Human Revolution speedruns. I don’t know why, but I love watching this bonkers secret agent save the world through inexplicable nonsense and hilarious stunt-jumping. </p>
<p><strong>37:00 Josh is fighting with Windows.</strong></p>
<p><strong>43:00 Ruts is also playing roguelikes!</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/">Stone Soup Dungeon Crawl</a>.</p>
<p><strong>48:00 Rutskarn is making a new campaign setting.</strong></p>
<p>Also he’s working on his FMV game idea in the margins. Also we talk about rollerblades for a long time. I can’t even explain why. It just happened.</p>
<p><strong>1:13:00 Shamus can do it.</strong></p>
<p>True story: At the one hour 13 minute mark Chris jokes that I could help Rutskarn make this FMV game. I didn’t join in on the joke, because a few minutes earlier Rutkarn had said that he would need to find someone to make the game, or that he would need to program it himself. </p>
<p>That immediately got me thinking, because writing a video player would be monumentally hard for a new coder, but the simple logic that drives a small-scale FMV game would be a fantastic thing for a new coder to work on.  So it seems like you’d need some kind of simplified video player (it would only need to handle one format) that used game logic as a front end. This got me to thinking about the most recent chapter of <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/">Game Programming Patterns</a>, which talked about building a virtual machine to process your own scripting language, so you can handle exactly these kinds of specialized problems where you need artists to be able to code simple things. (The example given in the book is a system where artists could add complex spell effects to the game without needing to get the coders involved. You just need to be able to examine and change stats and create particles.) So I started thinking about scripting languages and what you’d need to be able to do with one in order to drive an FMV game.</p>
<p>Suddenly my name came up in conversation and I had no idea what anyone was talking about. It wasn’t until I edited this episode that I realized I missed the joke about working on the project because I was daydreaming about how one would go about working on the project.</p>
<p><strong>1:16:00 Adventures With Content ID.</strong></p>
<p>Josh tells the story of when we tried to upload the New Year episode of Far Cry 4 and YouTube killed it because the credits used a copyrighted song. </p>

(The example given in the book is a system where artists could add complex spell effects to the game without needing to get the coders involved. You just need to be able to examine and change stats and create particles.) So I started thinking about scripting languages and what you’d need to be able to do with one in order to drive an FMV game.

Suddenly my name came up in conversation and I had no idea what anyone was talking about. It wasn’t until I edited this episode that I realized I missed the joke about working on the project because I was daydreaming about how one would go about working on the project.

Josh tells the story of when we tried to upload the New Year episode of Far Cry 4 and YouTube killed it because the credits used a copyrighted song.

Dear diecast/spoiler warning crew,
Have you ever considered doing riff tracks of movies or tv shows?
Umad
And here is the full question that we trimmed down: 

Hi, I’m Daniel (JackTheStripper on your website) and I wanted to ask the Diecast what they think of the current state of educational games.
I grew up playing games like Math Blaster Episode I: In Search of Spot, Math Blaster Mystery: The Great Brain Robbery, Where in The World (and Where in the USA) is Carmen San Diego, and even more classic games like Number Munchers. The fact that they were educational games never bothered me, and the challenge was there. I don’t think I ever beat any of those games on the harder difficulties.
Anyway, games like those are practically non-existent today, and with lots of indie devs bringing games of their childhood back, how is nobody trying to bring back educational games?
Hopefully there’ll be a Diecast in the coming days but I’ll understand if there isn’t with the holidays and all. Big fan of you guys though.
Always ludonarratively dissonant,
Daniel

        <![CDATA[<p>This week we have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pushinguproses">a guest</a> on the show. And since it’s December 22nd, I guess this qualifies our Christmas episode. Sort of. Not that we talk about Christmas. But, you know…. Merry Christmas. Or whatever. </p>

<p>Hosts: <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/">Shamus</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeChuck">Josh</a>, <a href="http://www.chocolatehammer.org/">Rutskarn</a>, <a href="http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/">the other Josh</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pushinguproses">Pushing Up Roses</a>. </p>
<p>Show notes:<span id="more-25420"></span></p>
<p><strong>2:00 Pushing Up Roses talks about her collection of antique computers.</strong></p>
<p>We talk about the IBM 5150, the Tandy 1000, old keyboards, and THIS monstrosity:</p>

And your engineer is Jigsaw." title="This is what you get when you have your engineer design your human interface devices. And your engineer is Jigsaw."></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
<p>If this is their “Deluxe Joystick”, then I’d hate to see what their shitty joysticks look like. Everything about this design is wrong. Let’s zoom in:</p>

<p>The stick is short and slender, making it both fragile and uncomfortable to hold. And then it’s crowned with a real, actual <strong>serrated edge</strong>. That’s a real thing that somebody did on purpose. And this design was in use for years. </p>
<p>The button is a nasty stiff cube with a smooth surface and sharp corners, so you can either rest your thumb on the surface and have it slip off, or push on the edge and let it poke you. The little levers beside the joystick are for adjusting the calibration. They’re right there in the open where you can brush against them and throw the joystick out of whack, so be sure to avoid touching those! (You’ll know if you do. They have serrated edges too.)</p>
<p>This joystick hates you.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Trigger warning: In this episode we talk about mass murder, censorship, and social justice. These are touchy subjects. Just remember to be nice and to not to post angry and we’ll get through this. </p>
<p>Thanks again to special guest George Weidman of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWqr2tH3dPshNhPjV5h1xRw">SuperBunnyHop</a> for joining in.</p>

<p>Hosts: <a href="http://farcry.wikia.com/wiki/Pagan_Min">Josh</a>, <a href="http://www.chocolatehammer.org/">Rutskarn</a>, <a href="http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/">Chris</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/bunnyhopshow" title="SuperBunnyHop on YouTube">George Weidman (SuperBunnyHop)</a>, and <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale">Shamus</a>.</p>
<p>Show notes:<span id="more-25287"></span><br>
<strong>2:00 George and Chris have been playing Far Cry 4 together.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4:00 The Game Awards 2014.</strong></p>
<p>You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlLvCLP2h84">the entire show on YouTube</a>. The whole “Dorito” joke is a reference to <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/doritosgate">Doritogate</a>. We joke, but the whole story is pretty sad. The journalist who criticized it wound up being fired, and the guy who participated (Geoff Keighley) went on to greater things and eventually hosted this awards show. I don’t think Keighley is a villain by any stretch, but he is kind of the poster boy for capitulating, malleable journalism in the face of overbearing publisher PR control. </p>
<p><strong>20:00 Grand Theft Auto V pulled from the shelves of Target in Australia.</strong></p>
<p>I have no idea what happened to this conversation. We became so sarcastic we wrapped all the way around and started arguing our sarcastic points in earnest. Or something?</p>
<p>I can only speak for myself, but I think my position is: GTA V is no worse in content than dozens of other things you can buy at Target and its removal is nothing more than shrill voices getting their way. On the other hand, I’m having trouble marshaling my outrage because the game is so obnoxious and sanctimonious towards the American culture that makes its success possible. The game is greeted with both fawning adulation and outraged calls for censorship, and I don’t think it deserves either. </p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: Haven’t played V yet because they’re dragging their feet on a PC release. This opinion is based on my impressions of IV, and of the bits of the game I’ve seen so far. I’ll find out first-hand when they finally get around to the PC release next month.</em></p>
<p><strong>35:00 MAILTIME!</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Why do so many games that let you be a bad guy never let you be THE bad guy? Like in Overlord, you’re always opposed by people who are worse than you somehow. Never better than you. Do people just want to DO bad, no BE bad?</p>
<p>Yours,<br>
Ira</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast!</p>
<p>With all the Dragon Age talk you guys have recently, I wonder if you’ve heard the news: the game has DRM that hasn’t been cracked, so far. This so called Denuvo DRM is also in FIFA 15 which has been out for 2 months, and also hasn’t been cracked.<br>
There has been rumors about it causing technical problems, but the worst they can really seem to pin on it is a few percent performance decrease. Any opinions? If they’ve finally made an uncrackable DRM, is that good or bad?</p>
<p>Your biggest fan,<br>
Csirke
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Shadows of Mordor has been criticized, including by Shamus, for completely contradicting much of the defining characteristics, central message, and tone of Tolkien’s work.</p>
<p>Has playing it given you any sympathy to people who object to the bait-and-switch they faced when playing Spec Ops: The Line? Would you have been able to appreciate the artistic statement if Shadows of Mordor had just been well-executed enough that it seemed to be saying Tolkien was wrong deliberately, yet still marketed itself as a straight Lord of the Rings game?</p>
<p>F. T. Garcia</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Josh: What is your favorite type of tea?<br>
Shamus: What is your favorite alcoholic drink?<br>
Everyone else: Answer whichever you want.</p>

PS: Sure hope I didn’t get the first two questions confused. Nah.</p></blockquote>

      <itunes:summary>Trigger warning: In this episode we talk about mass murder, censorship, and social justice. These are touchy subjects. Just remember to be nice and to not to post angry and we’ll get through this. 

Thanks again to special guest George Weidman of SuperBunnyHop for joining in.


Hosts: Josh, Rutskarn, Chris, George Weidman (SuperBunnyHop), and Shamus.

Show notes:
2:00 George and Chris have been playing Far Cry 4 together.

4:00 The Game Awards 2014.

You can watch the entire show on YouTube. The whole “Dorito” joke is a reference to Doritogate. We joke, but the whole story is pretty sad. The journalist who criticized it wound up being fired, and the guy who participated (Geoff Keighley) went on to greater things and eventually hosted this awards show. I don’t think Keighley is a villain by any stretch, but he is kind of the poster boy for capitulating, malleable journalism in the face of overbearing publisher PR control. 

20:00 Grand Theft Auto V pulled from the shelves of Target in Australia.

I have no idea what happened to this conversation. We became so sarcastic we wrapped all the way around and started arguing our sarcastic points in earnest. Or something?

I can only speak for myself, but I think my position is: GTA V is no worse in content than dozens of other things you can buy at Target and its removal is nothing more than shrill voices getting their way. On the other hand, I’m having trouble marshaling my outrage because the game is so obnoxious and sanctimonious towards the American culture that makes its success possible. The game is greeted with both fawning adulation and outraged calls for censorship, and I don’t think it deserves either. 

Disclaimer: Haven’t played V yet because they’re dragging their feet on a PC release. This opinion is based on my impressions of IV, and of the bits of the game I’ve seen so far. I’ll find out first-hand when they finally get around to the PC release next month.

35:00 MAILTIME!

Dear Diecast,
Why do so many games that let you be a bad guy never let you be THE bad guy? Like in Overlord, you’re always opposed by people who are worse than you somehow. Never better than you. Do people just want to DO bad, no BE bad?
Yours,
Ira
Dear Diecast!
With all the Dragon Age talk you guys have recently, I wonder if you’ve heard the news: the game has DRM that hasn’t been cracked, so far. This so called Denuvo DRM is also in FIFA 15 which has been out for 2 months, and also hasn’t been cracked.
There has been rumors about it causing technical problems, but the worst they can really seem to pin on it is a few percent performance decrease. Any opinions? If they’ve finally made an uncrackable DRM, is that good or bad?
Your biggest fan,
Csirke

Dear Diecast,
Shadows of Mordor has been criticized, including by Shamus, for completely contradicting much of the defining characteristics, central message, and tone of Tolkien’s work.
Has playing it given you any sympathy to people who object to the bait-and-switch they faced when playing Spec Ops: The Line? Would you have been able to appreciate the artistic statement if Shadows of Mordor had just been well-executed enough that it seemed to be saying Tolkien was wrong deliberately, yet still marketed itself as a straight Lord of the Rings game?
F. T. Garcia
Dear Diecast,
Josh: What is your favorite type of tea?
Shamus: What is your favorite alcoholic drink?
Everyone else: Answer whichever you want.

My question is, do you think writers should try to make more of an effort to account for the fact that players might not like a companion character, and let players do things like throw a companion out of the party – especially when they do controversial things like in this example – instead of seemingly writing characters under the assumption that players will love them?

Dear Diecast.

I was rewatching your Mass Effect-Spoiler Warning seasons recently, and one thing Shamus brought up during Mass Effect 1 was wanting to court-martial Ashley for killing Wrex, and throw her out of the party. My question is, do you think writers should try to make more of an effort to account for the fact that players might not like a companion character, and let players do things like throw a companion out of the party – especially when they do controversial things like in this example – instead of seemingly writing characters under the assumption that players will love them?

43:00 Surprise email, introduced mid-topic!

Dear Diecast,
Hi everyone! Did you know Ruts streamed the second half of the last Diecast (recorded 23/11/2014), and I got to listen to it live?
For an actual question, How do you feel about twists in game design, and especially games that outright reveal the twist, but keep it hidden only through the protagonist denying it?
All the best, keep diecasting,
Merzendi.
From here we go on to talk about the dangers of accidental livestreaming. This is a problem just waiting to make headlines.

46:30 And now back to the planned list of mailbag questions…

Die Dearcast,
Is there a foreseeable way put of the “everything is a franchise” mindset in the more expensive echelons of game development? If so, or if not, where do you think it might come from?
Yours,
Ira.
P.S.: Mr. Viel, what is a good entry point into the Shin Megami Tensei series? I’ve loved it from afar for a few years, but don’t know how or where to get involved.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>For the last two weeks I’ve had horrible internet connections during our recording sessions. Egregious throttling, lag spikes, etc. Very frustrating. This has made dialog even more problematic than usual. I’ve tried to clean up the interruptions and overlap as much as possible, but there’s only so much you can do in post. Please be patient.</p>

<p>Hosts: <a href="http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/">Chris</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader">Josh</a>,  <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale">Shamus</a>, and <a href="http://www.chocolatehammer.org/">Rutskarn</a>.</p>
<p>Show notes:</p>
<p><span id="more-24859"></span><strong>1:00 Chris is hosting!</strong></p>
<p>This is a running gag every week, where Josh tries to get Chris to host. These crazy kids and their shenanigans.</p>
<p><strong>2:00 Let’s talk about re-releases!</strong></p>
<p>In my talk on re-compiling games I was trying to think and talk at the same time, which is never a good sign. Having digested the topic a bit more, I’ll refine my points on C vs. C++ thus:  C is easier to read, easier to follow, and easier to debug, but <strong>only if your code is sufficiently small</strong>. My problems with C enter in as the codebase grows in complexity. The proliferation of side-effects and the lack of overarching structure eventually makes the project <em>harder</em> to understand than a comparable C++ project. (Note that some of this is stylistic and not mandated by the language itself.)</p>
<p>This is by no means a definitive statement on either language, but my view on how the two languages apply to the world of games. If you’re taking databases or operating systems, then I have no idea which is best or how they scale. </p>

      <itunes:summary>For the last two weeks I’ve had horrible internet connections during our recording sessions. Egregious throttling, lag spikes, etc. Very frustrating. This has made dialog even more problematic than usual. I’ve tried to clean up the interruptions and overlap as much as possible, but there’s only so much you can do in post. Please be patient.


Hosts: Chris, Josh,  Shamus, and Rutskarn.

Show notes:

1:00 Chris is hosting!

This is a running gag every week, where Josh tries to get Chris to host. These crazy kids and their shenanigans.

2:00 Let’s talk about re-releases!

In my talk on re-compiling games I was trying to think and talk at the same time, which is never a good sign. Having digested the topic a bit more, I’ll refine my points on C vs. C++ thus:  C is easier to read, easier to follow, and easier to debug, but only if your code is sufficiently small. My problems with C enter in as the codebase grows in complexity. The proliferation of side-effects and the lack of overarching structure eventually makes the project harder to understand than a comparable C++ project. (Note that some of this is stylistic and not mandated by the language itself.)

This is by no means a definitive statement on either language, but my view on how the two languages apply to the world of games. If you’re taking databases or operating systems, then I have no idea which is best or how they scale. 

23:00 Far Cry 4 dev says 1080p debate is a “weird echo chamber”

The fact that this would come from someone using the Cry engine – the poster child for the juvenile graphics-over-gameplay mentality – this comes off not just as dumb but as shockingly hypocritical. It’s like the team behind Games for Windows Live complaining that it’s a pain in the ass to need to log into Steam to play your game. 

35:00 Rutskarn is here and suddenly we’re talking about 7th guest.

Here is the Pushing Up Roses video I mentioned in the show, which gives a pretty good look at Night Trap and the controversy that surrounds it:




I will say that it’s really offensive to me that people complained about the nudity and violence the game didn’t have. Especially when they could have spent that time complaining about how bad it obviously sucked. Even the tiny clips are hard to watch.

Advisers can come to you with stories, “The worshipers of Molag Butts have great harvests and are unbeatable in battle!” Maybe Molag Butts is real and favoring his people.

the wiki page for Troll (internet variety)<br>
the wiki page for Macedonian, which you all had an argument over how to pronounce in that Diecast<br>

a recent Spoiler Warning<br>

This is all highly amusing. So the actual question: Has anyone else actually noticed this? Rutskarn and Jarenth had not.

<p>We didn’t actually answer this on the show, so for the record: For the first few dozen episodes, when I linked to Josh’s name in the hosts list I’d link to a different random thing every time. I stopped doing it because nobody noticed. But now I guess someone noticed.</p>

Dear Diecast,
Back in Diecast #2, drawn by Zach Snyder and written by Frank Quitely, the Diecasters made several humorous japes about possible future games based on the abused Aliens franchise.
One of them, Rutskarn’s “Hiding-based stealth game”, has(sorta) come true in the form of Alien: Isolation.
Judging by what I’ve seen and read, it doesn’t look like it’ll make up monetarily for Colonial Marines, or encourage future efforts like it. What are the odds that Sega will go back to small-hearted manshoots?
28:00

Dear Diecast team,
you probably know that Steam recently introduced Steam Curators, alongside the general store front overhaul. What do you think about it, and could you imagine acting as such a Curator yourselves? Maybe under the “Spoiler Warning” label, or as a “Twentysided Curator” or similar?
Best regards,
Niko

the wiki page for Macedonian, which you all had an argument over how to pronounce in that Diecast
various other wiki pages intended to be indicative of Josh’s grouchiness
the Guild Wars 2 wiki page for the weapon called Incinerator
a recent Spoiler Warning
whiskey
This is all highly amusing. So the actual question: Has anyone else actually noticed this? Rutskarn and Jarenth had not.

We didn’t actually answer this on the show, so for the record: For the first few dozen episodes, when I linked to Josh’s name in the hosts list I’d link to a different random thing every time. I stopped doing it because nobody noticed. But now I guess someone noticed.

      <itunes:summary>The plan this week was to talk about the canceled Blizzard MMO and a few other current topics. Instead we talked about a sixteen-year-old hack-n-slash. I don’t know. That’s how this show goes sometimes.

And yes, I’m still fiddling with the theme music. Based on the feedback last week, most people would prefer if I just went back to the original theme that we used for 70 episodes. I might. But allow me this little vanity for now. It’s short and I’m having fun with it.


Hosts: Jarenth, Josh,  Shamus, and Rutskarn.

Show notes:

2:00 Shamus is playing Diablo 2.

Here is the video I mentioned: Ideas about a new programming language for games.

19:00 Josh is playing Final Fantasy 13.

Warning: I’m pretty sure Josh spoils the plot of the game in this segment. I can’t tell for sure because I had slammed my hands over my ears, groaning uncontrollably after the first hour of his description.  

35:00 Jarenth is playing Concursion and Crypt of the NecroDancer.

Here is his review on Concursion.

But somehow we end up talking about leaderboad games. This is the game I was talking about. I like it a bunch. Just remember: Don’t tell Chris.

45:00 Rutskarn is playing Payday 2 and Far Cry 2.

But instead of talking about those he tells us some tabletop gaming stories, which are a lot more interesting.

        <![CDATA[<p>Experiment: This week I shifted the participants a little to the left or right speakers. My hope is that this can help untangle cross-talk when it happens. Usually one person just overpowers another, and if you want to hear the person who got drowned out, you’re out of luck.</p>
<p>I actually edit the audio to fix as much cross-talk as I can.  If (during recording) I charge in saying, “You know what? I think that-” and then I shut up because I realize I’m overlapping with someone else, then during editing I’ll just mute that phrase so the other person can be heard more clearly. Basically, when two people talk at once, I’ll mute the one who retreated. But there are still instances of overlapping that just can’t be helped.  Maybe this stereo separation will help, or maybe it will just be annoying and distracting. </p>

Yes, Nintendo is coming out with a new product that is just called “New [Old Product Name]”, which is fine when you’re making cereal or laundry detergent, but bad when you’re talking about devices with distinct generations and compatibility issues.

18:00 Shamus is playing Sunless Sea.

Sunless Sea is by the people who brought us Echo Bazaar / Fallen London.

23:00 Mumbles is playing Wind Waker.

25:00 Mumbles is also playing TF2 beta maps.

28:30 Mumbles has watched the Gotham Extended trailer.

39:00 Chris is playing Five Nights at Freddy’s.

We went a little off-topic before going WAY off topic, before coming back around and losing our way completely. Here is the Loading Ready Run skit that I mentioned. (My favorite.)

54:00 MAILTIME!

Die Dearcast,

1:00 The Next Tomb Raider game will be an Xbox One exclusive.

I’ll have a column about this tomorrow.

19:00 The sad state of the superhero MMO genre.

We’re talking about City of Heroes, Champions Online, DC Universe Online, and Marvel Heroes. Here is what I had to say about DC Universe Online way back in 2011. And here is what I had to say about Champions Online.

Here is the City of Titans Kickstarter that we discussed, and here is their website, which we were sort of mocking.

This discussion leads to the first mailbag of the week:

Dear Diecast,
With the recent re-opening of the Mass Effect Wounds at Twenty Sided and three recent tweets by Shamus, it seems appropriate to ask this question:
Why is it that after all this time and an Extended Cut DLC thatexplained everything’, the very mention of Mass Effect 3, a game that was released in March 2012, STILL has the ability to drive people nuts?

I answered this in part on the show, but I’m going to answer it more fully in tomorrow’s column.

25:00 Twitch TV has rolled out a dumb broken ContentID system.

Like I said the other day:




38:30 Sims 4 is missing a lot of features.

It didn’t sound like a big deal to me at first, but it all sounds kind of shocking when you actually read the list. It’s even more worrisome when you remember what happened to SimCity. Is EA going to ruin two major Maxis titles with their meddling? I’m perversely anxious to find out.

51:00 MAILTIME!

Dear Diecast,
Spoiler Warning has Reginald Cuftbert as a recurring character in every new game. Do any members of the cast have their own special character that makes a return in the various games that you play?

<p><del datetime="2014-08-04T20:30:46+00:00">At the start of the show there’s some debate about how long it’s been since Rutskarn was on the show.

<p>I think the reason Josh questioned the authenticity of the above question is that we had just been talking about this before the show, and it seemed kind of convenient to have an email pop up on the same topic. </p>
<p>With regard to how we record audio: I know we discuss this every six months or so, but the topic keeps coming up and I don’t know what else to do. It really <strong>seems</strong> like it should be super-easy to solve, so we get lots of helpful suggestions like, “I don’t see why you guys can’t just [impractical thing].” Explaining why the obvious solutions don’t work ends up being this fifteen minute enumeration of drawbacks and trade-offs. Sorry if this gets tedious. </p>
<p>Another thing that I’m realizing now is that we actually have different audio needs. The audio of Spoiler Warning is fine if it’s a little crappy. There’s game noise and music and shouting and it’s not expected to be high quality. Lots of internet shows have wretched audio and do just fine. But in podcasts, audio IS the content and some people have very very good audio setups. <a href="http://www.feartheboot.com/ftb/">Some shows</a> have high-end mics and compressors and all the hosts gather in the same room so latency isn’t a problem. They can get pro-quality audio. Our hosts have thousands of miles between us, and some of us are on sub-optimal machines, in noisy houses, with spotty internet.</p>
<p>I actually fuss with the audio of the Diecast quite a bit. If three people talk at once, sometimes I can mute or time-shift people to clear up the collisions, and I do what I can to even out the volume levels and make the show slightly less aurally unpleasant. (Chris has an electric hum sometimes. Rutskarn sometimes has ambient room noise like dogs barking or people talking. I have a ton of fans around me, flooding my recordings with white noise. Mumbles has really intense volume variations, from quiet whispers to explosive shouts. Josh’s hands-free setup results in occasional bits of background noise or sniffling that need to be silenced. And EVERYONE has different volume levels every week.)   </p>
<p>So yeah. It’s harder than it seems. </p>
<blockquote><p>I’m curious since you have actual professional experience with 3D internet what your thoughts are on VR internet. For Diecast or Blog or even just reply to me. </p>
<p>It started to sound like a stupid question to me as I was typing because we’re probably going to have MMO VR right? But then lag would probably be a big issue and MMOs are proprietary single owner platforms.</p>
<p>I guess there’s a question in there. I don’t need an answer, I’d just like to hear or see you pontificate on this. </p>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>This episode is a continuation of the same session as the previous Diecast. A side note about the recording of this episode is that – time zones being what they are – the sun was coming up for Jarenth when we finished recording this show, and at the same time it had only recently gone down for Josh. This might also explain why Jarenth isn’t as chatty as you were hoping. </p>
<p>Again, thanks for staying up so late to make these episodes happen. </p>

<p>Hosts: <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/trollface-coolface-problem">Josh</a>, <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale">Shamus</a>, <a href="http://www.ninja-blues.com/">Jarenth</a>, and <a href="http://krellen.net/">Krellen</a>.</p>
<p>Show Notes:<br>
<span id="more-23858"></span></p>
<p><strong>0:30 Shamus is playing Bulletstorm.</strong></p>
<p>Due to poor planning on my part, <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=23810" title="Bulletstorm: Lowbrow, Loud, Juvenile, and Proud">my full review of Bulletstorm</a> already appeared earlier this week. So now you get the more rambling, less organized, I-haven’t-finished-it-yet version. </p>
<p><strong>6:00 Krellen has played Unrest.</strong></p>
<p>This section is spoiler-free.</p>
<p><strong>7:00 Krellen is also playing Saints Row IV Co-op.</strong></p>
<p><strong>10:30 Krellen played through System Shock 2 for the first time ever last week.</strong></p>
<p><strong>27:00 Jarenth has been playing <a href="http://forever-entertainment.com/fryderyk/">Frederic – Resurrection of Music</a>.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ninja-blues.com/2014/07/28/indie-wonderland-frederic-resurrection-music/">Here is his writeup over on Ninja Blues</a>.</p>
<p><strong>33:30 Jarenth is also playing Magic 2015.</strong></p>
<p><strong>35:00 MAILTIME!</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Diecast,</p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed, Mass Effect and Too Human were all reported to be trilogies and long term franchises during their respective pre- and post- release press hype. Ironically, the games also were announced/released around the same time. How do you all feel about Too Human suffering the best fate?</p>
<p>Thanks for the podcast/show,<br>
Steven</p></blockquote>

      <itunes:summary>This episode is a continuation of the same session as the previous Diecast. A side note about the recording of this episode is that – time zones being what they are – the sun was coming up for Jarenth when we finished recording this show, and at the same time it had only recently gone down for Josh. This might also explain why Jarenth isn’t as chatty as you were hoping. 

Again, thanks for staying up so late to make these episodes happen. 


Hosts: Josh, Shamus, Jarenth, and Krellen.

Show Notes:


0:30 Shamus is playing Bulletstorm.

Due to poor planning on my part, my full review of Bulletstorm already appeared earlier this week. So now you get the more rambling, less organized, I-haven’t-finished-it-yet version. 

6:00 Krellen has played Unrest.

This section is spoiler-free.

7:00 Krellen is also playing Saints Row IV Co-op.

10:30 Krellen played through System Shock 2 for the first time ever last week.

27:00 Jarenth has been playing Frederic – Resurrection of Music.

Here is his writeup over on Ninja Blues.

33:30 Jarenth is also playing Magic 2015.

35:00 MAILTIME!

Diecast,
Assassin’s Creed, Mass Effect and Too Human were all reported to be trilogies and long term franchises during their respective pre- and post- release press hype. Ironically, the games also were announced/released around the same time. How do you all feel about Too Human suffering the best fate?
Thanks for the podcast/show,
Steven
What do each of you think is the most prevalent problem affecting stories of games?

<p><strong>11:00 Crytek’s <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2014/7/27/5941815/crytek-rumor-homefront-statement">ongoing financial problems</a>.</strong></p>
<p>We glossed over a point that I wanted to talk about in more detail: As Jarenth said, Crytek is known for making “really pretty” games. Or game engines. But we’re so far past the point of diminishing returns that their skills are basically moot. Think of it this way: Imagine the programmers at Crytek could suddenly make all their graphics run 50% faster. You can just hand-wave it and say a wizard makes it so that when running Cry Engine games, graphics cards have 50% more power.</p>
<p>I maintain that this benefit – even though it’s a complete miracle – would be of very limited business value. Homefront flopped, and that had nothing to do with its graphics. (In fact, I’m pretty sure the graphics were the only thing they got right. Which makes it even more mysterious as to why CryTek would bother with it.) When was the last time a game really sold on the basis of its graphics alone? AAA graphics are like pizza and sex: Even when they’re way below average, they’re still pretty great. </p>
<p><strong>27:00 The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/winterkewlgames/yogventures/posts">Yogventures Kickstarter</a> did not <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/07/17/yogscast-cancel-kickstarter-backed-yogventures-say-its-failure-is-a-deep-regret/">end well</a>.</strong></p>
<p>And here is the related mailbag question:</p>

<p>The Yogventures story is so sad. Half a million bucks, and very little to show for it other than a lot of rumors and finger-pointing.

<strong>00:30 Intro, wherein Campster makes a joke about fedoras.</strong></p>
<p>For the record: I joined in on the joke, but I actually think the fedora is a fine hat when worn in the right context. It’s gotten a bad reputation online from some people attempting to build their persona / establish a character around a simple hat, and it’s been rightfully maligned because some people insist on wearing them with otherwise casual clothing. A fedora is a “dress up” hat, not a “dress down” hat, and wearing it casually is like pairing a bowtie with an <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ed+Hardy+shirt&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS518US518&amp;es_sm=122&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZE7MU6OHB9agyAS214GwDw&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1192&amp;bih=760&amp;dpr=1.5">Ed Hardy shirt</a>. (PROTIP: <strong>DO NOT.</strong>)</p>
<p>But if you don a fedora with proper slacks, a dress shirt, and a vest? Ignore the haters. That shit is <em>dapper</em>.</p>
<p><strong>01:00 Let’s talk about <a href="http://pyrodactyl.com/">Unrest</a>.</strong></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>19:00 We talk about food for no reason.</strong></p>
<p>I feel like a failure as a host. When Josh started talking about how the appendix was a vestigial organ, I was kind of torn. Do I let him know that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermiform_appendix#Maintaining_gut_flora">appendix has actually been found to have a purpose</a>, thus dragging us even further off-topic? Or do I let him go, thus increasing the number and intensity of the corrections in the comments? Maybe I made the wrong call. I guess we’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>21:00 Back to Unrest.</strong></p>
<p>Get it from <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/292400">Steam</a>, Humble Bundle, or from the <a href="http://pyrodactyl.com/">developer’s website</a>. </p>
<p><strong>23:00 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1wUirNlR0U">MAIL TIME</a>!</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi,<br>
I have heard Shamus say several times that YouTube ContentID can identify cutscenes but cannot identify gameplay.<br>
I understand that you do not have inside knowledge of Content ID, but do you as a gamer/programmer see any issue with IDing a game by its UI/HUD? It is distinctive for every game (or franchise) and it is always in the same place on screen.<br>
Thanks</p>

It’s like seeing a classical marble bust of Spongebob. Anyway, share it on Facebook or GeoCities or Angelfire. Or Tumbl it. Or Twit it.

      <itunes:summary>Just before this episode went live, Josh sent me a link to this, which is probably the most unsuitably high-quality image of Reginald Cuftburt ever produced. It’s like seeing a classical marble bust of Spongebob. Anyway, share it on Facebook or GeoCities or Angelfire. Or Tumbl it. Or Twit it. Whatever it is you young people do with data when you’re doing internet show-and-tell.


Hosts:
Josh, Shamus, Mumbles, and Campster.

Show notes:

1:00 Shamus is playing Retro/Grade and Girls Like Robots.

Here are my original thought on Girls Like Robots after PAX 2012.

3:30 Shamus watched THE LEGO MOVIE.

Warning: Lengthy Batman conversation ensues. Here’s the Batman song we discussed. We also talk about Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man.

18:00 Mumbles is playing Divinity: Original Sin.

28:00 Chris has been playing Payday 2.

33:00 Chris has also been playing Valiant Hearts.

The rest of us haven’t played it.  Here is what SuperBunnyHop has to say about it. 

37:00 Chris has also been playing Dead Rising 3.

Wait, Dead Island 2 is being made by Yeager, the team behind Spec Ops: The Line? I have no idea how I feel about that. It’s either brilliant or idiotic. 

46:00 Chis also got the Super Ultra Dead Rising 3′ Arcade Remix Hyper Edition EX + Î±.

That title is the kind of thing I make up to make fun of games with overly elaborate titles. Capcom knows all my moves, so they countered me by making a double ridiculous title. What am I supposed to do now? Make a triple ridiculous name? Or maybe reverse it and call the game “Dave”? Nah. I know when I’m beat.

You win this time, Capcom.

50:00 The challenges of having a large Steam library, buying games for making content, using footage from other people, fair use, YouTube culture, and Net Neutrality.

This is a little bit insider-y, but it’s the kind of stuff we worry about when shopping for games and making content. 

Warning: Shamus becomes sad.

1:00:00 Mail time!

Dear Diecast,
What genres of music do guys enjoy and how well do you think they’ve been implemented in games?

<p>I’ll admit I’ve been totally unfair to Origin. They’re making modest, incremental progress into the market and as someone who has been publicly hounding them to change, I really ought to <strong>at least</strong> have the decency to check out their free games. </p>

<p>What you’ve heard here is true: I do not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing">touch-type</a>. That’s pretty ridiculous for someone who types for a living. It’s like a professional driver not knowing how to operate a manual transmission. At any rate, if you’re looking to learn to touch-type, Typing of the Dead is not a good place to start.</p>
<p>Note the 22 minute mark when I try to explain how long it’s been since I was 15 years old. Nothing will destroy your capacity to perform simple math like making calculations based on your own age. When the left half of your brain offers up the right answer, the right half of your brain will jump in with, “Ridiculous! It can’t possibly have been that long. It’s probably… half that. Yeah. Half-ish.” </p>
<p><strong>33:00 Shamus talks about <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seanyoung/magicite-a-multiplayer-rpg-platformer">Magicite</a>.</strong></p>
<p>As I’m doing this write-up, I’ve discovered that <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seanyoung/magicite-a-multiplayer-rpg-platformer">Magicite is a Kickstarted game</a>. I should also add that if you’ve got a background with 2D platformers (like if you grew up with the NES, as I’m sure is true of most of the target audience of this game) your experience will likely be very different than mine.

        <![CDATA[<p>Here is an hour of four people talking about videogames. I don’t know why you like this sort of thing, but it’s not my place to judge. </p>

<p>Show notes:<span id="more-23417"></span></p>
<p><strong>01:00 E3 Wrap-up.</strong></p>
<p>We say we don’t have anything left to say about E3, but then we talk about it for ten minutes. And since we brought up both Anthony Burch and panels, that gives me an excuse to link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm0rrGBin5Q">Dying is Funny, Comedy is Easy</a>, a presentation by Burch on why more games should embrace comedy.</p>
<p><strong>10:00 Watch_Dogs is a tone-deaf narrative with hackneyed characters.</strong></p>
<p>Chis and I talk about the game at length. Spoiler: It’s not our Game of the Year.</p>
<p><strong>19:00 Let’s talk about something else.</strong></p>
<p>Like the terrible Watch_Dogs gameplay.</p>
<p><strong>38:00 Somewhere along the line we lose the plot and talk about Ubisoft and Elder Scrolls.</strong></p>
<p>We didn’t even plan to discuss Elder Scrolls this week. It just happened. </p>
<p><strong>50:00 Steam Summer Sale!</strong></p>
<p>Actually, while we were going to talk about the sale for this segment, we just wound up talking about what we’re playing. Go figure.</p>
<p>Chris is playing <a href="http://amon26.itch.io/in-the-kingdom">In the Kingdom</a> and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/games/killer-instinct#fbid=B0Qlpcntr1O">Killer Instinct</a>.</p>
<p>I’m playing <a href="http://riskofraingame.com/">Risk of Rain</a>. Also <a href="http://www.puppygames.net/revenge-of-the-titans/">Revenge of the Titans</a> from <a href="http://www.puppygames.net/">Puppygames</a>. In this segment I said I had all the titles from Puppygames. Not so! They now have <a href="http://www.puppygames.net/droid-assault/">Droid Assault</a>, which is part of the Steam sale at the moment. So NOW I have all the Puppygames.</p>

<p>Show notes:<span id="more-23295"></span> </p>
<p><strong>01:00 Chris talks about a movie.</strong></p>
<p>Apparently <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=336">Do it Again, Stupid</a> is now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_of_Tomorrow_(film)" title="Edge of Tomorrow">a movie</a>?</p>
<p><strong>4:00 Just kidding. That last section was just us arguing about groundhog(s) for no good reason. NOW we’re talking about Edge of Tomorrow.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw61gCe2oqI">Here’s a trailer, if you’re interested.</a></p>
<p><strong>6:00 Chris played Among the Sleep.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.krillbite.com/ats/">Official site.</a></p>
<p><strong>12:00 Rutskarn is playing The Walking Dead: Season 2.</strong></p>
<p>This discussion is spoiler-free. </p>
<p><strong>20:00 Mumbles is upset about what happened to the Shield.</strong></p>
<p>Not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.">these guys</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shield_(professional_wrestling)">These guys</a>.</p>
<p><strong>29:30 Mumbles and Chris talk Mario Kart.</strong></p>
<p><strong>37:00 Shamus has Played Wolfenstein: The New Order.</strong></p>
<p>My column (should go up on Tuesday) is about the game. The question of “Is this Jewish conspiracy offensive or not?” is likely to be a touchy one. This is a sensitive subject handled in a very broad-strokes game, and it’s probably not particularly useful to get enraged at people who feel too much or too little outrage relative to yours. <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/columns/criticalintel/11570-Wolfenstein-and-the-Power-of-Resistance" title="Critical Intel: Wolfenstein and the Power of Resistance">Robert Rath had a column last week</a> where he came down strongly on the “This is not okay” side of the argument. I didn’t like the idea when I heard it, but when I saw it in the game I was basically willing to go along with it.</p>
<p><strong>58:00 Josh had an X-Man movie marathon!</strong></p>
<p>We talk about the early X-Men movies, the latest X-Men movie, and the X-Men comics. This conversation was really confusing and hard for me to follow, but I think there are <em>Days of Future Past</em> spoilers in there. Maybe. </p>

      <itunes:summary>The number one requested feature for the show is an RSS feed for the podcast that handles the audio tagging properly. I’ve never figured out how to do this in WordPress without importing ridiculous podcasting contraptions or crawling down into the guts of WordPress to do it myself. But! Someone has set one up for us. I don’t use RSS and I can’t comment on how compatible / reliable / useful / accurate it is. It’s hosted off-site and I don’t know anything about it other than:


It exists.
Seems to work for everyone who has tried it so far.

Thanks for putting that together.


Hosts:
Josh, Sham, Puns, Cannibal Wrestling, and Regret.

Show notes: 

01:00 Chris talks about a movie.

Apparently Do it Again, Stupid is now a movie?

4:00 Just kidding. That last section was just us arguing about groundhog(s) for no good reason. NOW we’re talking about Edge of Tomorrow.

Here’s a trailer, if you’re interested.

6:00 Chris played Among the Sleep.

Official site.

12:00 Rutskarn is playing The Walking Dead: Season 2.

This discussion is spoiler-free. 

20:00 Mumbles is upset about what happened to the Shield.

Not these guys. These guys.

29:30 Mumbles and Chris talk Mario Kart.

37:00 Shamus has Played Wolfenstein: The New Order.

My column (should go up on Tuesday) is about the game. The question of “Is this Jewish conspiracy offensive or not?” is likely to be a touchy one. This is a sensitive subject handled in a very broad-strokes game, and it’s probably not particularly useful to get enraged at people who feel too much or too little outrage relative to yours. Robert Rath had a column last week where he came down strongly on the “This is not okay” side of the argument. I didn’t like the idea when I heard it, but when I saw it in the game I was basically willing to go along with it.

58:00 Josh had an X-Man movie marathon!

We talk about the early X-Men movies, the latest X-Men movie, and the X-Men comics. This conversation was really confusing and hard for me to follow, but I think there are Days of Future Past spoilers in there. Maybe.

1:30 Chris talks about Wolfenstein: The New Order

Here are the Polygon articles Chris mentioned: 

Wolfenstein is the rare game that shows sex as both fun and healing

Wolfenstein: The New Order shows you the horror of concentration camps from the first-person.

16:00 Shamus had a fight with Google. 

The post is down until I get this sorted out, although you can see the original text here. You can decide for yourself if that qualifies as outrageous adult content. For contrast, here is the Call of Roma ad that was repeatedly deemed okay by Google under the same standards. Which means Google was regularly putting stuff on my site that was – by any reasonable measure – far more offensive than what they banned me for. And in both cases I was denied any way to tell them their system was malfunctioning.

Running a Patreon campaign is a big deal for me. It’s going to take me a little while to set it up. I’ll talk more about this once I figure out what I’m doing.

28:00 A digression on various obnoxious / annoying / “evil” internet companies, from Google to Amazon.

This is what made me dislike Amazon, and question if our patent system does objectively more damage than good in the world.

39:00 Mumbles talks about Bombshell and female characters created by female designers.

49:00 Shamus and Mumble hijack things and talk comics for a bit.

We talk about Punisher, Dr. Strange, and The Superior Foes of Spider-Man. Tragically, TSFoSM isn’t yet available on Marvel Unlimited. At least, I think it isn’t. Their search functionality and catalog indexing is atrocious. 

EDIT: I found it. Their own search engine was useless. Google took me right to it.

54:00 Chris and Josh talk about Transistor.

<p>Show notes:<span id="more-23047"></span></p>
<p><strong>0:30 Josh is playing Dark Souls 2. Still!</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we’re having the “<em>Dark Souls isn’t hard it’s punishing except what does that really mean and let’s compare it to other hard games.</em>” talk again. I feel like we gnawed that bone to the marrow last time around, so if that discussion happens again I’m probably going to sit it out. </p>
<p><strong>22:00 Shamus has been been reading Marvel Comics!</strong></p>
<p>Titles read: Guardians of the Galaxy. Astonishing X-Men. Ultimate Spider-Man. Little bit of Punisher. Random samplings of Deadpool and classic Spider-Man.</p>
<p>Here is the <a href="http://badassdigest.com/2014/05/06/film-crit-hulk-smash-hulks-237-burning-questions-for-the-amazing-spider-man/" title="Film Crit Hulk Smash: HULK'S 237 BURNING QUESTIONS FOR THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2">FILM CRIT HULK SMASH AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2</a>.

<p><strong>35:00 Rutskarn is working on <a href="http://pyrodactyl.com/">Unrest</a> and his tabletop RPGs.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/292400/" title="Unrest">Unrest is not available for pre-order</a> on Steam, but it has a Steam page anyway. So that’s cool. Also, <a href="http://www.chocolatehammer.org/">Chocolate Hammer</a> might be revived soon. Cross your fingers.</p>

      <itunes:summary>Hosts: Josh, Rutskarn, Chris, and Shamus.

Show notes:

0:30 Josh is playing Dark Souls 2. Still!

Yes, we’re having the “Dark Souls isn’t hard it’s punishing except what does that really mean and let’s compare it to other hard games.” talk again. I feel like we gnawed that bone to the marrow last time around, so if that discussion happens again I’m probably going to sit it out. 

22:00 Shamus has been been reading Marvel Comics!

Titles read: Guardians of the Galaxy. Astonishing X-Men. Ultimate Spider-Man. Little bit of Punisher. Random samplings of Deadpool and classic Spider-Man.

Here is the FILM CRIT HULK SMASH AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2. Here is MovieBob’s review.

35:00 Rutskarn is working on Unrest and his tabletop RPGs.

Unrest is not available for pre-order on Steam, but it has a Steam page anyway. So that’s cool. Also, Chocolate Hammer might be revived soon. Cross your fingers.

55:00 Rutskarn shares some of the experimental tabletop games he’s been playing.

1:05:00 Chris has been playing Civilization. All of them.

Outro: Slamba Yetu.

<p>…until it all turned green and fell off. But I’m nearly back to normal now. In the meantime, the kids did the show without me. I’m listening to the show for the first time as I write this, so we’re going to experience this together. </p>
<p>Let’s do this:</p>

<p>Hosts: <a href="http://www.jamesonwhiskey.com/us/agegate">Josh</a>, <a href="http://www.chocolatehammer.org/">Rutskarn</a>, <a href="http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/">Chris</a>, and <a href="http://digitalmumbles.com/">Mumbles</a>.</p>
<p>Show notes:</p>
<p><span id="more-22938"></span><strong>2:00 Chris has entered the strange world of mobile gaming. He’s playing <a href="http://www.gameloft.com/mobile-games/jurassic-park/">Jurassic Park</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Really? The game is just called “Jurassic Park”? Not “Jurassic Park: Mobile” or “Jurassic Park: Reviving Previously Extinct Species to have them Fight to the Death in a sick and Decadent Pit-Fight in the Name of Animal Cruelty Because Obviously”? Nothing to distinguish it from the movie, or the hundreds of other games that have also failed to do justice to the Jurassic Park mythos? No?</p>
<p>Okay then.</p>
<p><strong>9:00 Chris is playing <a href="http://rustysrealdealbaseball.nintendo.com/">Rusty’s Real Deal Baseball</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>18:30 Mumbles has been learning The Console Gaming.</strong>  </p>
<p>Specifically, she’s been playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Defense_Force_2017">Earth Defense Force 2017</a>. After that she’s going to play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asura's_Wrath">Asura’s Wrath</a>, which I gather is a videogame of some sort.</p>
<p><strong>29:00 Apparently we digressed into Hearthstone at some point? That’s the new card game thing, right?</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>32:00 Josh is playing Dark Souls 2 and <a href="http://www.strongholdkingdoms.com/">Stronghold Kingdoms</a>.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>40:00 Rutskarn is playing Planescape Torment.</strong></p>
<p>For the record: Yes, I played through Planescape Torment. You lightweights.</p>
<p><strong>48:00 The Star Wars Extended Universe is not recognized as canon by Disney.</strong></p>
<p>I am not surprised by this. J.J. Abrams rebooted ALL OF STAR TREK, and I suspect it was partly because he didn’t want to have to do a hundred hours of research every time someone pushed a button in the movie. He’s not my first choice for either franchise, and he’s never going to give us a <em>Wrath of Khan</em> or an <em>Empire Strikes Back</em>. But in my book he’s like Michael Bay except he knows to to make a movie. It might be cheap, disposable entertainment, but at least it holds together as a cohesive story with proper character beats. And I’ll take ridiculous LENS FLARE over incomprehensible, puke-inducing shaky-cam any day.</p>
<p>Hang on. After I typed that last paragraph I remembered that Abrams just made Star Trek Into Darkness, and it <em>did</em> try to re-create Wrath of Khan, and it <em>wasn’t</em> a cohesive story at all. I haven’t watched it, but that’s what I heard, anyway. Did I just bolster my position before destroying it? I don’t know. I report. You deride. </p>
<p>ANYWAY.</p>
<p>This might be for the best. Abrams strikes me as not the best person to manage the intersection of dozens of films and books. He’s not a detail guy, and he would probably just infuriate fans if he actually tried to build on existing extended universe canon. It’s far better for him to be up front and honest about what he’s doing so we can go in with our expectations properly calibrated. </p>
<p><strong>1:00:00 Shouldn’t the show be about over by now? Are we still talking about Star Wars? </strong></p>
<p>NERDS!</p>
<p><strong>1:03:00 Josh isn’t kidding. <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ice_Cream_Maker_Guy">Here is the guy with the ice cream maker</a>.</strong></p>

Dear Diecast,
The Unreal Engine 4 launched recently, with a very interesting pricing model. A flat monthly subscription fee and 5% off the top is an amazing direction to go in compared to their previous pricing models and removes the barrier to entry for indie developers. Do you think we’ll see a huge surge of indies using the engine? Are you tempted to try it out yourself? I know I am.

<p><strong>19:30 Let’s Talk about HOT MEN.</strong></p>
<p>We’re actually talking about this Gamasutra Article: <a href="http://gamasutra.com/blogs/JaneJensen/20140414/215473/WRITING_HOT_MEN_FOR_GAMES_Yes_please.php">WRITING HOT MEN FOR GAMES?

<p>What follows is nearly fifteen minutes where four straight men and a straight woman try to figure out which dudes are hot. Spoiler: <em>The Straight Men aren’t very good at this.</em></p>
<p><strong>32:00 Who is Dennis Hopper?</strong></p>
<p>We often feign outrage for comedic effect, but I was actually stunned silent when the guys described <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000454/">DENNIS HOPPER</a> as “the guy who played King Koopa”.

<p>Show notes:<span id="more-22813"></span></p>
<p><strong>1:20 Josh is playing FTL: Advanced Edition.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=17335" title="FTL: Random vs. Skill">My write-up on FTL is here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>8:00 Chris is playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbheiGx0-A">Disney Magical World</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>13:00 Chris is also playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qsdIveYJ0Y">Actual Sunlight</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Interesting that this is the <a href="http://www.depressionquest.com/">second</a> game about depression I’ve run into in the last few months.</p>
<p>Personal talk:</p>
<p>I’ve had days where I woke up and found I couldn’t feel joy or happiness or even contentment. Where nothing felt worth doing. The usual fire I had to consume and talk about games (or do anything else) was just… <em>gone</em>. There was never any reason for this. Everything was fine in my life, aside from the fact that my mood was unaccountably mis-calibrated. I don’t know that this is anything like the clinical depression that some people talk about, but I use it as a frame of reference. My episodes always blow over after a few days and don’t linger for weeks or months on end. </p>
<p>Regardless of whether this is depression or not, it’s certainly an interesting phenomena. We tend to assume that our moods are linked to our situations, and it can be completely baffling and frustrating when that connection is broken. <em>I have no reason to be sad right now. So why am I sad?</em></p>
<p>Having never played either game myself, I do wonder what the intent behind them is. Are they a way for people suffering from depression to feel some sort of connection with each other? Is this a way of saying “You are not alone” to others? Or is this intended to share the experience with people who have never been through it and don’t understand what it’s like?</p>
<p>I wish I’d asked Chris during the show, but I’d love to hear from anyone who has played either game.</p>
<p><strong>15:00 Shamus is working on programming. But not Good Robot.</strong></p>
<p>Stuff I’m working on / thinking about:</p>
<p>1) GLSL shading language. 2) Systems which are incredibly robust with regards to consistency of framerate. 3) Different techniques for offloading CPU work onto the graphics card.</p>
<p>Maybe we’ll talk about this later in the week. Maybe not. I still need to finish my write-up on Thief.</p>
<p><strong>16:00 <a href="http://www.civilization.com/#trailer">Civilization: Beyond Earth</a> has been announced. So we spend a bunch of time talking about Alpha Centauri.</strong></p>
<p>This topic gets derailed by religion in games. If you want to skip that, jump ahead to somewhere around the 37 minute mark.</p>
<p><strong>26:00 Surprise mid-podcast mailbag!</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>What do you think about religion in video games as a mechanic and why is Christianity not as explored as Greek and North mythology?</p>
<p>-Adrian</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>34:00 We talk about Jade Empire.</strong></p>
<p><strong>37:00 And back to Civilization.</strong></p>

34:00 We talk about Jade Empire.

37:00 And back to Civilization.

44:00 Mailbag!

Dear Diecast/Shamus
So we’re familiar with your stance on graphics resources.  After reading your recent article on the Oculus Rift, do you think the “graphics arms race” is (truly) relevant again in the games industry because of VR?
~Ian
Amazing question. I’d already been thinking about this it for a while when the question showed up, so I had a lot to say about it.

Dear Diecast,
Do you find international perspectives on games to be interesting? For example, is Diecast irregular Jarenth valuable for his Dutch-ness as well as his Jarenth-ness?
Cheers,
Neil from England
Let me plug Jarenth here while I have an excuse.

Show notes:

1:00 Christopher is playing Goat Simulator

Here is the Goat Simulator trailer, which is a send-up of the infamous Dead Island trailer. And I’m pretty sure this is the Farming Simulator Joke Jarenth was taking about.

8:00 Joshua is still playing Dark Souls.

17:00 Joshua also played BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea DLC. Both of them. Together.

31:00 Dr. Jarenth has been playing Netrunner.

Here is the Leigh Alexander piece on Netrunner, which is what got both Chris and Jarenth interested in it. Also, he’s been playing a bit of Creeper World 3.

35:00 Shamus is playing Terraria.

38:00 Shamus and Josh talk about Archer.

Here is the Archer YouTube channel, to give you an idea of what the show looks like. Note that in the latest season they’ve abandoned the spy motif for a Miami Vice motif. Haven’t seen it yet myself. Netflix releases typically lag behind broadcast television.

42:00 MAILBAG!

After seeing the Machine for Pigs episode, I felt I should ask: What’s the most minimalistic game that you enjoyed enough to recommend? Conversely, what’s the most complex game that you can recall engrossing you?
-Rueben


Shamus chronicles his development adventures quite well for us, but what about the rest of you? Have you dabbled in game development at all and what did you think?
Even that stupid text adventure you wrote in high school could be fun to talk about.
-Taylor
This is my favorite question in ages. It turns out all of us have dabbled in game development. Also I talk a bit about the programming I’ve been doing lately. 

I’m sure this topic will come up in the show itself, but I figured I’d try to make sure of it.
What do you guys think about Facebook buying Occulus?  I mean, a global megacorporation that knows everything about everyone taking over the industry leader in virtual reality is basically the setup for almost every cyberpunk setting ever, right?

        <![CDATA[<p>This is it: The great Mailbag Reckoning. If you sent in a question before March 26<sup>th</sup> and it hasn’t been answered before, then it’s either answered today, or never. All questions are forever answered, or forever ignored. </p>
<p>To be clear: If your question didn’t make the cut, it doesn’t mean it was a bad question. It might just mean we didn’t have anything to say on the subject. If you ask about something and there’s less than three people that have something to say about it, then we usually set the question aside. </p>

<p>Hosts: <a href="http://www.jamesonwhiskey.com/us/agegate">Josh</a>, <a href="http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/">Chris</a>, <a href="http://digitalmumbles.com/">Mumbles</a>, and <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale">Shamus</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2:00 What are some RPG systems you don’t like?</strong></p>
<p><strong>21:00 What happens when a vocal group of players demands things that are antithetical to the design?</strong></p>
<p><strong>30:00 What are your favorite board games / card games?</strong></p>
<p><strong>36:00 What are your thoughts on procedural content?</strong></p>
<p><strong>51:00 Question time is over. Chris talks about Infamous: Second Son.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1:04:00 Josh is playing Assassins Creed: Liberation.</strong></p>
<p>Have a question for the cast? Address is in the banner at the top of the post. To have the best chance of it making it onto the show: </p>
<ol>
<li>Try to keep it no more than two sentences.

      <itunes:summary>This is it: The great Mailbag Reckoning. If you sent in a question before March 26th and it hasn’t been answered before, then it’s either answered today, or never. All questions are forever answered, or forever ignored. 

To be clear: If your question didn’t make the cut, it doesn’t mean it was a bad question. It might just mean we didn’t have anything to say on the subject. If you ask about something and there’s less than three people that have something to say about it, then we usually set the question aside. 


Hosts: Josh, Chris, Mumbles, and Shamus.

2:00 What are some RPG systems you don’t like?

21:00 What happens when a vocal group of players demands things that are antithetical to the design?

30:00 What are your favorite board games / card games?

36:00 What are your thoughts on procedural content?

51:00 Question time is over. Chris talks about Infamous: Second Son.

1:04:00 Josh is playing Assassins Creed: Liberation.

Have a question for the cast? Address is in the banner at the top of the post. To have the best chance of it making it onto the show: 


Try to keep it no more than two sentences.
Aim for subjects that the whole cast can discuss. (So, questions about Good Robot would be bad, since it would just be me talking.)

1) How do you feel about cheat codes and what are your favorites?

<p><strong>12:00 OOPS FEMINISM</strong></p>
<p>It’s hard to stop talking about this subject once you get started. For me the compelling thing is the completely anarchic and asymmetrical nature of the debate. This isn’t a two-sided war between people who want female protagonists and people who don’t. This is a multi-faceted debate where extremists tend to get the most attention. There are a lot of different types of “feminists” (who might not even self-identify as feminists<span class="snote" title="1">I don’t self-identify as one, but I’ve been called one. Labels are dangerous things and the LAST thing I want is another argument over what the word “feminist” means.</span>) who just want more female protagonists. Then there are angry people who think that sexy characters are inherently destructive and that enjoying some T&amp;A makes you a horrible person. Then the other side fails to draw a distinction between these two positions and hilarity ensues. Add in a handful of really ugly, Angry Young Men who spew hate and threats. Then have the feminist side<span class="snote" title="2">And remember, this side is actually several sides that don’t all self-identify as feminist.</span> paint all of the opposition as if they were in league with – and sympathetic to – the Angry Young Men. Add in a couple of layers of counter-backlash to either side and suddenly it’s really hard to understand how such a simple idea can generate so much outrage.</p>
<p>This complete mayhem creates a desire from people like me to clear up this confusion. Maybe I can’t settle the debate, but maybe I can at least help the various sides understand the complexity of the conflict? But no. My efforts never help and I just end up being yet another idealistic idiot shouting into the storm. And so it goes.</p>
<p>Rutskarn mentioned this post from <a href="http://susanarendt.com/2014/03/04/why-titanfalls-launch-trailer-made-me-emotional/">Susan Arendt on the Titanfall trailer</a>. </p>
<p>We also talk about women being integrated into the US Navy. This is such a sad topic for me. There are a lot more anecdotes like the one I told. The problem is that the whole subject is dripping with politics, and even people doing the right things are often doing them in the wrong way and for the wrong reasons. For reference, these events happened around 1991 through 1993. (My brother was in boot camp when the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailhook_scandal">Tailhook scandal</a> took place.) I don’t know how the Navy is doing these days, but the early days of co-ed service were a complete mess. I could fill several pages with stories about how completely dysfunctional the service was and about how ugly and unfair (to both genders) integration was. </p>

      <itunes:summary>Due to some recent changes, it’s harder than ever to get the whole crew together for our weekly recording sessions. Our various job situations are changing, making it harder for us to find windows of mutual availability. I don’t know what this means, long-term. We’ll do what we can.


Hosts: Josh, Chris, and Shamus. 

Show notes: 

3:00 Shamus is playing Rise of the Triad

For those of you you’ve never heard of it before, this is Catacombs of the Abyss:




It pre-dates Wolfenstein, and is one of many games that competes for the murky title of “first FPS”. 

7:00 Shamus is also playing Puzzle Quest: Galactrix

In this segment we went off-topic and talked about oddball product tie-in games. I mentioned Chase the Chuckwagon. That’s a real game that’s a dog food product tie-in from 1983. My friend David had a copy. Even though we were kids and the videogame industry was in its infancy, we were still able to recognize that the existence of the game was inherently preposterous. 

Also mentioned: Avoid the Noid. 

I’d never heard of Chex Quest until now. 

14:30 Chris is playing Assassins Creed: Freedom Cry

22:30 Chris is playing Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare.

31:30 Josh shares a Project Zomboid anecdote.

39:00 MAIL TIME!

And yes, we answer several questions this week. These are good ones. Remember to send your questions in for next week. (Email in the banner at the top.)

TRIGGER WARNING: We discuss rare vs well-done steak, which to some people is a religious topic. For some reason.

      <link>http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=22416</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Here is an entire episode dedicated to a single game. Thief [4] has been a long time coming. Some have been excited to see it return. Some hopeful. Some outraged. Some resigned. But now we’ve played it and we can see the result for ourselves. </p>
<p>It’s not the game we hoped for, but neither is it the train wreck we feared. </p>

<p>Hosts: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt">Josh</a>, <a href="http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/">Chris</a>, and <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale">Shamus</a>. </p>
<p>The entire show is about Thief, so no timestamps. We spoil some of the themes of the story during the show, but nothing that shouldn’t be incredibly obvious after the tutorial. </p>
<p>At the 57-minute mark we talk about the ending, so you might want to skip that part if you’re spoiler-averse.  Although as Chris says, the story is pretty much broken, and I don’t think spoilers will hurt you. And by “broken” I mean, “clearly a patchwork of different revisions of the story that don’t fit together or form a proper sequence of events”. </p>

<p>We also dig into the EA conversation again. Because that’s not getting old.

I couldn’t find the promised link about how former EA boss John Riccitiello spent a lot of money on free-to-play games, but I did find <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-07-31-john-riccitiello-slams-opportunists-who-just-want-to-profit-from-games">this interview from shortly after his departure</a>, which came with this pull quote:</p>

<p><a href="http://candyswipe.com/king.html">Here is the statement from the creator of Candy Swipe</a>. The guy made Candy Swipe in 2010. The King.com made a rip-off of the game in 2012.

<p>For thos eof you confused by the chaos, what happened is that Rutskarn lagged out. Ventrilo then queued up all of his chat over the space of 30 seconds and delivered it all at once. Not sure why Josh left that in, but there you go.</p>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>This episode was recorded AFTER our <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?page_id=16386">Spoiler Warning</a> session this week, but it’s being released first. We were a little tired and a couple of hosts short by the time we got to this point. </p>

<p>Hosts: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelly_bean">Josh</a>, <a href="http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/">Chris</a>, and <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale">Shamus</a>.</p>
<p>Show notes:<span id="more-22170"></span></p>
<p><strong>1:00 Shamus is playing Elder Scrolls Online and EVE Online.</strong></p>
<p>We can’t talk about ESO yet. (Embargoed until Feburay 7th.) But we can talk about <a href="http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/the-bloodbath-of-b-r5rb/">the battle of B-R5RB</a>. Note that we had this conversation before I did the homework for <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=22139">my recent EVE post</a>.</p>
<p><strong>28:00 We move on from EVE and talk about space games more broadly.</strong></p>
<p>Like I said in the show, there are a lot of space games on the way. Check it out: <a href="https://blockaderunnergame.com/">Blockade Runner</a>, <a href="http://elite.frontier.co.uk/">Elite: Dangerous</a>, <a href="http://www.felixvast.com/">Felix Vast</a>, <a href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/">Kerbal Space Program</a>, <a href="http://badlandstudio.com/kinetic-void/">Kinetic Void</a>, <a href="http://ltheory.com/">Limit Theory</a>, <a href="http://www.mandategame.com/">The Mandate</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRpDn5qPp3s">No Man’s Sky</a>, <a href="http://pulsarthegame.com/">Pulsar: Lost Colony</a>, <a href="http://elliptic-games.com/">Rodina</a>, <a href="http://www.spaceengineersgame.com/">Space Engineers</a>, <a href="http://star-made.org/">Star Made</a>, <a href="http://playstarbound.com/">Starbound</a>, <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/about-the-game">Star Citizen</a>, and <a href="http://www.starpointgemini.com/">Starpoint Gemini 2</a>. </p>
<p>Did I miss any?</p>
<p><strong>34:00 Chris is playing Call of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Juarez:_Gunslinger">Juarez: Gunslinger</a>.</strong></p>
<p>We only cover this briefly. Not because there’s nothing to talk about, but Rutskarn already went over this a couple of months ago.</p>
<p><strong>38:30 Chris is also playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bureau:_XCOM_Declassified">The Bureau: XCOM Declassified</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/comics/stolen-pixels/7435-Stolen-Pixels-186-Well-Lookie-Who-We-Have-Here">Here’s the rant</a> (and comic) that I wrote about this game way back in 2010, when it was still in development. Here’s the Polygon Article Chris mentioned: <a href="http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/8/19/4614410/xcom-the-bureau-development-2006-2013">The many faces of the bureau: xcom declassified: from 2006 to 2013</a></p>
<p>This conversation got sidetracked into…</p>
<p><strong>43:00 Another Mass Effect rant? Really? REALLY?</strong></p>
<p>I blame Chris. </p>
<p><strong>53:00 Mailbag!</strong></p>
<p>We talk about Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition and about Steam Early Access program and the difficulties of defining when a game is “done”.</p>
<p>Request: When you send us a question (the address is in the splash image at the top of the post) please put “Diecast” in the title so Josh can find them when we finally get around to reading them.</p>

      <itunes:summary>This episode was recorded AFTER our Spoiler Warning session this week, but it’s being released first. We were a little tired and a couple of hosts short by the time we got to this point. 


Hosts: Josh, Chris, and Shamus.

Show notes:

1:00 Shamus is playing Elder Scrolls Online and EVE Online.

We can’t talk about ESO yet. (Embargoed until Feburay 7th.) But we can talk about the battle of B-R5RB. Note that we had this conversation before I did the homework for my recent EVE post.

28:00 We move on from EVE and talk about space games more broadly.

Like I said in the show, there are a lot of space games on the way. Check it out: Blockade Runner, Elite: Dangerous, Felix Vast, Kerbal Space Program, Kinetic Void, Limit Theory, The Mandate, No Man’s Sky, Pulsar: Lost Colony, Rodina, Space Engineers, Star Made, Starbound, Star Citizen, and Starpoint Gemini 2. 

Did I miss any?

34:00 Chris is playing Call of Juarez: Gunslinger.

We only cover this briefly. Not because there’s nothing to talk about, but Rutskarn already went over this a couple of months ago.

38:30 Chris is also playing The Bureau: XCOM Declassified

Here’s the rant (and comic) that I wrote about this game way back in 2010, when it was still in development. Here’s the Polygon Article Chris mentioned: The many faces of the bureau: xcom declassified: from 2006 to 2013

This conversation got sidetracked into…

43:00 Another Mass Effect rant? Really? REALLY?

I blame Chris. 

53:00 Mailbag!

We talk about Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition and about Steam Early Access program and the difficulties of defining when a game is “done”.

Request: When you send us a question (the address is in the splash image at the top of the post) please put “Diecast” in the title so Josh can find them when we finally get around to reading them.

<p><strong>11:00 Josh is playing the game Adobe Premiere Doesn’t Friggin’ Work Dammit Hell Shit.</strong></p>
<p>Josh also talks about a Crusader Kings II succession game he’s talking part in. For the uninitiated, CKII is a strategy game where you guide a particular dynasty through the ages.

<p>Show notes: </p>
<p><span id="more-21987"></span><strong>01:00 Shamus got over his Skyrim problem and made screensaver.</strong></p>
<p>For the record, the mods I was using are <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26228/?">Realistic Needs &amp; Diseases</a>, <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11163/?">Frostfall</a>, and <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25404/?">Random Alternate Start</a>, along with about 40 others.</p>
<p>I already talked about the screensaver <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=21977" title="Passage Screensaver">earlier this week</a>.</p>
<p><strong>13:00 The Elder Scrolls Online</strong></p>
<p>Here is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZUynhkal1I" title="TUN: The Elder Scrolls VI - Youtubia">Nerdrage video on Elder Scrolls</a>. </p>
<p><strong>51:30 Chris is writing things and talking about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbv9rs9bVOE">Alien Isolation</a>.</strong></p>
<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien:_Isolation">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Alien Isolation] is set in 2137, 15 years after the events of Alien and 42 years before the events of Aliens. It focuses on Ellen Ripley’s daughter Amanda who, while in search for her mother, goes to a space station: Sevastopol, unaware that the Xenomorphs have already infested the place.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whaaat?</p>
<p>So you’re playing as Ripley’s daughter. Who is an adult. Not only does this muck with establish canon, but it drags in a character that was better left where she was: Having lived a perfectly mundane and unremarkable life on Earth. </p>
<p>A much better idea? Let us play as Newt. You wouldn’t have to screw with any existing lore, and the mechanics are all right there in the movie: Newt survives by hiding in tight spots and using her wits. She can crawl through the duct work and watch the Aliens tear through the colonists. We’ve got a huge installation to work with and lots of blank space on the timeline. It would be a very cat-and-mouse type stealth, where the tension comes from the times when you’re obliged to leave the safety of the vents and venture into the open to accomplish something. </p>
<p>I’m not saying it can’t be a great game, but the whole “Ripley’s daughter” thing smacks of ham-handed fanfiction. </p>
<p>Having said that: This is the first Alien game in ages that sounds promising. Survival stealth? Oh yeah. I’m on board with that.</p>

13:00 The Elder Scrolls Online

Here is the Nerdrage video on Elder Scrolls. 

51:30 Chris is writing things and talking about Alien Isolation.

From Wikipedia:

[Alien Isolation] is set in 2137, 15 years after the events of Alien and 42 years before the events of Aliens. It focuses on Ellen Ripley’s daughter Amanda who, while in search for her mother, goes to a space station: Sevastopol, unaware that the Xenomorphs have already infested the place.
Whaaat?

So you’re playing as Ripley’s daughter. Who is an adult. Not only does this muck with establish canon, but it drags in a character that was better left where she was: Having lived a perfectly mundane and unremarkable life on Earth. 

A much better idea? Let us play as Newt. You wouldn’t have to screw with any existing lore, and the mechanics are all right there in the movie: Newt survives by hiding in tight spots and using her wits. She can crawl through the duct work and watch the Aliens tear through the colonists. We’ve got a huge installation to work with and lots of blank space on the timeline. It would be a very cat-and-mouse type stealth, where the tension comes from the times when you’re obliged to leave the safety of the vents and venture into the open to accomplish something. 

I’m not saying it can’t be a great game, but the whole “Ripley’s daughter” thing smacks of ham-handed fanfiction.

<p>I find this <em>incredibly encouraging</em>. I might give this topic a post of its own, but the short version is that by sponsoring a show directly, the money ends up in the hands of the people who make the content we love. Compare this to the old model where:</p>
<ol>
<li>Acme buys advertising space on YouTube.
</li><li>The ad runs on a video made by Bob.
</li><li>Carla clicks on the ad. (Probably by accident, if my own surfing habits are any indication.)
</li><li>YouTube gives a tiny little bit of the advertising money to Bob.
</li></ol>
<p>And all too often:</p>
<ol>
<li value="5">Actually, some jackass copyright troll flags Bob as producing infringing content and siphons off some of his revenue while Bob spends time disputing the claim instead of making more content.
</li></ol>
<p>Acme can’t tell where their ad shows up or who will see it in this madcap YouTube world.  YouTube doesn’t care about the quality of Bob’s show as long as people watch it. Bob doesn’t care about Acme as long as he gets his money. When Carla clicks, it’s not because she likes Bob’s show, but because she’s ostensibly interested in Acme. The parties all have goals that are either completely unrelated or even in conflict. </p>
<p>It’s an awful system, and the only reason we’re using it is because we don’t have anything better. Services like Subbable and Patreon might be a way to route around this madness. </p>
<p>Like Errant Signal? Want to encourage it? <a href="http://www.patreon.com/errantsignal">You can support it here</a>. And as Chris is quick to say: <em>The show will continue whether you give or not.</em> Giving is your way of saying, “Dear internet. Make more stuff like this.”</p>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Happy new year! Rather than doing a big year-end retrospective, we talked about the here &amp; now like we usually do. </p>

<p>Note that I produced this episode. Josh usually does it, but he’s visiting his parents and doesn’t have access to his normal equipment. So any complaints about the audio quality should be directed at me. Note also that I make about two episodes a year, so your complaints won’t do any good because I end up re-learning the whole process from scratch every time. </p>
<p>Hosts: <a href="http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/">Chris</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus">Josh</a>, <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale">Shamus</a>.</p>
<p>Show notes:<span id="more-21904"></span><br>
<strong>3:00 Josh is sick, and so he’s taking <a href="http://www.fireballwhisky.com/index.cfm">Fireball Whiskey</a> in search of the cure.</strong></p>
<p>To be clear, I don’t know if gargling with alcohol is medically useful for killing throat-based infections, but it FEELS like it helps. The only reason I doubt it is: If all you needed to do to kill throat cultures was gargle alcohol, wouldn’t they have figured it out ages ago? Wouldn’t this just be standard procedure for sore throats? </p>
<p>As an aside: How could you do a proper <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment">double-blind</a> study on this? With most tests, you can easily administer a placebo without detection. But the test subject is going to feel that alcohol in their throat and the control subject won’t, and that sensation is going to skew the results. I don’t know. I  think the best solution is for us to make a field trip to the liquor store and begin what I’m calling a “blind drunk trial”.</p>
<p>Given how good it feels, I can’t believe this treatment doesn’t go all the way back to the middle ages.</p>
<p><strong>8:30 Josh got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_TIE_Fighter">Tie Fighter</a> working on his tablet, using a 360 controller with <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/">Dos Box</a>.</strong></p>
<p>This is madness. Awesome madness.</p>
<p><strong>9:00 Josh is playing <a href="http://projectzomboid.com/">Project Zomboid</a></strong></p>
<p>We throw out the term “offsite SVN” without explaining it.  For the record, SVN is a system for keeping track of source code. An offsite one is a place where you can upload your code so that even if your computer gets hit by an asteroid, you still have a complete record of your code, your documentation, and the history of the project. VERY useful. I use <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a>.</p>

      <itunes:summary>Happy new year! Rather than doing a big year-end retrospective, we talked about the here &amp; now like we usually do. 


Note that I produced this episode. Josh usually does it, but he’s visiting his parents and doesn’t have access to his normal equipment. So any complaints about the audio quality should be directed at me. Note also that I make about two episodes a year, so your complaints won’t do any good because I end up re-learning the whole process from scratch every time. 

Hosts: Chris, Josh, Shamus.

Show notes:
3:00 Josh is sick, and so he’s taking Fireball Whiskey in search of the cure.

To be clear, I don’t know if gargling with alcohol is medically useful for killing throat-based infections, but it FEELS like it helps. The only reason I doubt it is: If all you needed to do to kill throat cultures was gargle alcohol, wouldn’t they have figured it out ages ago? Wouldn’t this just be standard procedure for sore throats? 

As an aside: How could you do a proper double-blind study on this? With most tests, you can easily administer a placebo without detection. But the test subject is going to feel that alcohol in their throat and the control subject won’t, and that sensation is going to skew the results. I don’t know. I  think the best solution is for us to make a field trip to the liquor store and begin what I’m calling a “blind drunk trial”.

Given how good it feels, I can’t believe this treatment doesn’t go all the way back to the middle ages.

8:30 Josh got Tie Fighter working on his tablet, using a 360 controller with Dos Box.

This is madness. Awesome madness.

9:00 Josh is playing Project Zomboid

We throw out the term “offsite SVN” without explaining it.  For the record, SVN is a system for keeping track of source code. An offsite one is a place where you can upload your code so that even if your computer gets hit by an asteroid, you still have a complete record of your code, your documentation, and the history of the project. VERY useful. I use BitBucket.

Also, I claimed I was a “one man operation”, which is completely untrue. I have Peter Olson going over my revisions and making sure it all works on Linux.

19:00 Chris is playing The Pinball Arcade and Simpsons: Tapped Out.

27:00 We talk about the new Rise of the Triad. Here is footage of the original.

35:00 Shamus is playing Skyrim. 

We talk about the oddball leveling, the screwy balance, the broken economy, and the way the modding scene is becoming more visible and useful to the community.

Shamus Young is a programmer, an author, and nearly a composer. He works on this site full time. If you’d like to support him, you can do so via Patreon or PayPal.

<p>Neil (or Neal? Or perhaps Kneel? I don’t have the email handy) asks:</p>
<p><em>“How much do you think the bad behavior of and reputation of so-called “gaming culture” has to do with it coinciding with the transparency and anonymity of the internet?”</em></p>
<p>This might be our favorite question so far. It certainly launched the most discussion, and I’ll bet we could have filled an entire episode on the topic if we wanted.</p>
<p>During this discussion I mention <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/jimquisition/8371-Cloak-and-Dagger">this episode of Jimquisition</a>, talking about how most game journalism is simply relaying information provided by marketing.

Neil (or Neal? Or perhaps Kneel? I don’t have the email handy) asks:

“How much do you think the bad behavior of and reputation of so-called “gaming culture” has to do with it coinciding with the transparency and anonymity of the internet?”

This might be our favorite question so far. It certainly launched the most discussion, and I’ll bet we could have filled an entire episode on the topic if we wanted.

During this discussion I mention this episode of Jimquisition, talking about how most game journalism is simply relaying information provided by marketing. We also discuss Neil Gaiman‘s Angela character. The business side of her character is a lot more interesting than the narrative side.

1:04:30 Why gender-based discussions suck so bad.

Hoping we can get through this topic with minimal loss of life.

Hosts: Rutskarn, Josh, Mumbles, Chris, and Shamus.

Show notes:

1:30 Josh played Home.

In the process of discussing the game and the horror genre in general, we talk about 7th Guest and the recent 7th Guest 3 Kickstarter.

20:00 Chris is playing Batman: Arkham Origins and Battlefield 4.

We also spend some time talking about good ol’ Team Fortress 2 and how the game has changed.

35:00 Shamus has been playing indie games. The Void, Spelunky, and Eldrich.

Of these three games: He praises one, complains about a second, and hates on the third. But not in that order.

49:00 Mumbles has been playing Batman: Arkham Origins.

Here is an in-depth discussion about the new Batman game from Mumbles. 

1:00:00 Rutkarn has played The Wolf Among Us and Typing of the Dead: Overkill.

<p>While the stuff we discuss are spoilers in the technical sense, I don’t know if we’re actually likely to ruin any surprises. I’m not even sure the conversation will make sense. We might say nonsense things like, “Did you get the toaster ending? When the siren went off I didn’t know where to go, but then that door opened up and the narrator did the thing with the wastebasket.” It’s gibberish to someone who hasn’t played.</p>

<p>1) Terrible, terrible spoilers.<br>
2) Annoying impenetrable nonsense. </p>
<p><strong>14:00 Batman: Arkham Origins</strong></p>
<p>We also briefly digress into talking about the new Saint’s Row DLC.</p>
<p><strong>27:00 Okay, I lied. We didn’t actually spoil the Stanley Parable in that earlier segment. </strong></p>
<p>This segment is also free of Stanley Parable spoilers.</p>
<p><strong>39:00 We will not be discussing the Stanley Parable in this segment.</strong></p>
<p>Actually, I lied again.  The previous segment is packed with Stanley Parable spoilers. It’s brimming with them.  In fact, I don’t think you could get a greater density of spoilers than what we had in the last segment. This segment is safe, though.</p>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Feel sorry for Chris.  We got to do the podcast this week, while he was forced away from his job and dragged to Disney World. He’s probably miserable right now, sitting in the gorgeous weather and scenery, drinking a beer, and wishing he was with his internet-friends. He can’t even produce an Errant Signal from there. Poor guy.</p>

<p>Hosts: <a href="http://www.chocolatehammer.org/">Rutskarn</a>, <a href="http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Spy">Josh</a>, <a href="http://digitalmumbles.com/" title="Digital Mumbles">Mumbles</a>, and <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale">Shamus</a>.</p>
<p>Show notes: <span id="more-21208"></span></p>
<p><strong>1:00 Shamus is annoyed with how the game Brothers ended.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SPOILERS!</strong> We go on to compare other well-known downer endings and talk about what makes an ending work and what doesn’t. We talk about The Walking Dead, Mass Effect 3, and Brothers. It was impossible to have this conversation without a few spoilers. </p>
<p>I still recommend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers:_A_Tale_of_Two_Sons">Brothers</a>, and I recommend spoiling the ending first. </p>
<p><strong>7:45 Mumbles is Birthday-ing this week. She’s also playing GTA V.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>22:00 Here we ramble our way into talking Borderlands 2. </strong></p>
<p><strong>26:30 Josh talks a little bit about his experience playing Good Robot.</strong></p>
<p><strong>31:30 Talking about Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>34:00 Rutskarn is playing <a href="http://www.ftlgame.com/">FTL</a> and <a href="http://www.gunpointgame.com/">Gunpoint</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>53:00 Mailbag!</strong></p>

      <itunes:summary>Feel sorry for Chris.  We got to do the podcast this week, while he was forced away from his job and dragged to Disney World. He’s probably miserable right now, sitting in the gorgeous weather and scenery, drinking a beer, and wishing he was with his internet-friends. He can’t even produce an Errant Signal from there. Poor guy.


Hosts: Rutskarn, Josh, Mumbles, and Shamus.

Show notes: 

1:00 Shamus is annoyed with how the game Brothers ended.

SPOILERS! We go on to compare other well-known downer endings and talk about what makes an ending work and what doesn’t. We talk about The Walking Dead, Mass Effect 3, and Brothers. It was impossible to have this conversation without a few spoilers. 

I still recommend Brothers, and I recommend spoiling the ending first. 

7:45 Mumbles is Birthday-ing this week. She’s also playing GTA V. 

22:00 Here we ramble our way into talking Borderlands 2. 

26:30 Josh talks a little bit about his experience playing Good Robot.

31:30 Talking about Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs.

34:00 Rutskarn is playing FTL and Gunpoint.

53:00 Mailbag!

In talking about Dreamfall, I referenced my old rant on the end of the game. Check it out:

I’m sure fans of the game will be quick to point out that this is the second act in a three-act play. Great. The first installment came out in 1999. Adventure games and budgets being what they are, there is no guarantee that the next game will even be made. And even if it is, I don’t really care to wait for it.

Correct on all counts. I’m 42, my daughter is about to turn 16, and I barely remember the game aside from being angry at the end. Also relevant is this ancient post on why I dislike episodic games.

He’s also playing Hate Plus, sequel to Analogue: A Hate Story. I’m giving this bit its own segment here in the notes because it runs long and it has spoilers for the first game. 

27:30 Chris is playing a lot of stuff. To wit:

Disney Infinity, Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell: Blacklist and Saints Row IV.

50:00 Elder Scrolls Online will have subscription fees. 

Story here. We also discuss Wildstar.

        <![CDATA[<p>We don’t talk about Gone Home in this episode, but we wanted to. We do spend the first segment of the show talking about how we reacted to the game. I don’t know if it’ll get its own one-off special, or if we’ll just give it a couple of weeks so people can play through it. But I will say the response from the cast is universally positive. </p>

      <itunes:summary>I’m pretty proud of the conversation we had about game journalism.  We had a lot of different views, we looked at it from a lot of different angles, and I think some smart things were said. 

In other news: Someone suggested that putting the fully qualified URL to the audio in the RSS feed would help the Diecast show up for podcasting software.  I have done this. I’m sure you’ll let me know if it helped. 


Hosts: Shamus, Josh, and Mumbles, Chris but not Rutskarn.

Show notes:

02:30  What’s everyone doing?


20:00 Warren Spector: Where’s Gaming’s Roger Ebert?


45:30 Pacific Rim. (And then Rutskarn shows up and we talk about random things for 15 minutes.

58:30 Mumbles talks comics!

1:17:30 Mailbag.

        <![CDATA[<p>Some behind-the-scenes info: We generally forward news stories to each other all week. When Sunday rolls around, we take the headlines for the week, sort them out, and figure out which ones we want to talk about and which ones we don’t. Then we record the show.</p>
<p>This week we had nothing. Not one news story. I don’t know if we weren’t following the news or we didn’t care, but we had no stories and nothing to say. We just got together for our once-a-week blather session and Josh began recording halfway through. That means this podcast is even less structured than last week. Just so you know what you’re getting into. In any case, the choice was between this and nothing.</p>
<p>We’ve got a good slate of stories now, so the Diecast should return to normal next week. In the meantime, you’ve been warned:</p>

<p>Show notes:</p>
<p><span id="more-20279"></span><strong>00:00</strong> No introductions. No host. No news items. NO HOPE.</p>
<p><strong>00:30</strong> We join the podcast in mid-conversation, talking about <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1022603/">500 Days of Summer</a> and Scott Pilgrim. For reference, <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=8999" title="Scott Pilgrim vs. MY FACE">here is what I had to say about Scott Pilgrim when it came out</a>. The <a href="http://moviebob.blogspot.com/">MovieBob</a> video <a href="http://www.chocolatehammer.org/" title="Chocolate Hammer">Rutskarn</a> mentioned is here: <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/the-big-picture/7373-Dumping-Irony" title="The Big Picture: Dumping Irony">The Big Picture: Dumping Irony</a>. </p>
<p><strong>09:30</strong> We troll <a href="http://digitalmumbles.com/">Mumbles</a> by not talking about Batman. Instead we talk about Green Lantern, The Aristocrats, and Tacos. </p>
<p><strong>15:00</strong> <a href="http://www.scribblenauts.com/scribblenauts/unmasked">Scribblenauts</a></p>
<p><strong>24:00</strong> Josh is playing Skyrim. Mumbles video on Skyrim is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84WvpwyEJw8" title="The Mumbles Problem: Skyrim">here</a>. Then we segue into talking about Fallout: New Vegas</p>
<p><strong>52:30</strong> MAILBAG! We discuss sharing the hobby, the Kinect, and visual fidelity and game budgets.</p>
<p>Also, I want to apologize to Neil (or Neal) who sent in the long question. While short questions are always better than long in this format, that’s no reason for me to be a jerk about it. Bad form. In my defense, we’d been at this for a couple of hours by this point and I was getting a bit frazzled. </p>
<p>If you’ve got a question for the cast, send it to <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" >[email&nbsp;protected]</a> Also: Short questions make for better launching points for conversation. Long questions are better left in the comments. (I used to have a special page where people could leave long questions for me to answer. Looks like it got culled last time I tinkered with the site. I’ll look into bringing that back.)</p>

<p>Josh couldn’t make it this week. My USB headset broke and my backup evidently has a white noise generator built into it. I did the editing. We forgot to do the mailbag segment. So basically, this episode features the usual level of polish and professionalism you’ve come to expect from us. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Also! We we be doing a hangout on Thursday, April 25 at 7pm Eastern Time. (Which works out to midnight on Friday morning, GMT.) I’ll post links and give a heads-up when the show is ready to go live. </p>

      <itunes:summary>Josh couldn’t make it this week. My USB headset broke and my backup evidently has a white noise generator built into it. I did the editing. We forgot to do the mailbag segment. So basically, this episode features the usual level of polish and professionalism you’ve come to expect from us. Enjoy!


Also! We we be doing a hangout on Thursday, April 25 at 7pm Eastern Time. (Which works out to midnight on Friday morning, GMT.) I’ll post links and give a heads-up when the show is ready to go live. 

Show notes:

00:30 What’s Everyone Playing?

Shamus is playing Thief 2 and Thief 3. 

Chris is playing Surgeon Simulator 2013. Which he says is QWOP meets Trauma Center. Also he’s playing Starseed Pilgrim.

Rutskarn has played 30 Flights of Loving

And then we spend several minutes talking about Minecraft mods because I wasn’t sure if people wanted to talk about Minecraft mods.

23:00 It’s the triumphant return of “Bad SimCity News of the week”! You can get free SimCity DLC by buying specially-marked boxes of toothpaste or whatever. At least it’s not Doritos and Mountain Dew this time.

33:20 The developer of the MMO Salem creates a definition of the word “game”. Shocking turn: He crafts a definition specifically to favor things he likes and exclude things he doesn’t.

During the discussion, I brought up Realm of the Mad God, which was the basis for the recent Spoiler Warning joke title Realm of the Bad Dog, which nobody noticed. Alas. Also we discussed (and made fun of) Peter Molyneux’s Curiosity – What’s Inside the Cube?

45:30 Cevat Yerli, the CEO of Crytek, says that graphics are “60% of the game”.

The “shattering ribcage” joke was a reference to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2XkTIYhQC8">Surgery Simulator 2013</a>, which is probably the greatest misappropriation of the word “simulator” in the history of games. </p>

00:30 What’s everyone playing?

Rutskarn is playing BioShock Infinite.  

Jarenth is playing BioShock Infinite and Anodyne.

Chris is playing BioShock Infinite.

Josh is recovering from surgery where nope it’s too gross for me to type you’ll have to listen and hear for yourself. The “shattering ribcage” joke was a reference to Surgery Simulator 2013, which is probably the greatest misappropriation of the word “simulator” in the history of games. 

Shamus was playing BioShock Infinite and BioShock Infinite.

12:00 Horrible SimCity news this week: Here is the max happiness, max density city with no public services, no jobs, no goods, no resources, no government, no electricity, no hospitals, no crime, no homelessness, and no police. Here is the Something is Wrong With The Offices post that Josh referenced. Here is the video of the broken roads in SimCity. But don’t get worked up, because American McGee thinks everyone needs to calm down. 

21:00 Our giant unplanned tangent on piracy. 

28:00 Retro City Rampage. Chris was talking about the WiiWare Game. I was talking about ROM City Rampage, which is a theoretical port of the game to N64 NES hardware. Here is the video where he describes doing the port. It’s amazing.  

31:00 Remember APB? $100 million to make a crappy, laggy, mechanically boring PvP GTA MMO that closed its doors in 90 days. Then they got an infusion of cash to get the servers back on. And now… now they’re doing a Kickstarter. For a sequel. 

The discussion morphs into a conversation about Kickstarter in general. Then it’s a conversation about business start-ups. Note that when I said, “Nobody wants to live in a small town” what I really mean is, “EXTROVERTS don’t want to live in a small town.” I strongly suspect the habit of gathering in massive expensive super-cities is a side-effect of 75% of us being extroverts. 

54:00 Activision’s Tech Demo.  Here is the duck demo from a few years back.

<p>We should probably title these things or something. I mean, if we’re going to keep making episodes then at some point we’ll be like, “Wait.

No, 230 was when we discussed Sony’s inexplicable decision to design the Playstation 5 with a cotton-candy pink case.” </p>
<p>Then again, I have no idea how to title long multi-topic discussions in a memorable way. Screw it. We’ll just kick this problem on down the road and let future-us deal with it.</p>

<p><strong>40:00</strong> SimCity. Man, does this story have legs or what? We recorded this on Sunday night, and here on Thursday the follies continue. Sadly, this means a lot of the stuff we discussed or speculated about has now been resolved or rendered moot, only to be replaced by new failures.

1:03:30 The Blip.tv story. Here is what Chris posted about it. And here is the original post where I hurled bricks at the company after too many trips through the same advertisement: Blip.tv Sucks. Stay classy, Shamus.

<p>With Shamus out for the week, I host and Jarenth guest stars on this exciting installment of the Diecast!</p>

<p>And now for the show notes, complete with the oft-requested timestamps!</p>
<p>00:15 – We talk about what we’ve been doing for the past week. Shamus is a zombie, Chris is a Tomb Raider, Rutskarn is Homestuck, Jarenth’s lost in Echo Bazaar, and I’ve been set on the Path of Exile.</p>
<p>15:55 – Everything and more about the Playstation 4 announcement, and in particular, the implication that “more polygons = stronger emotional connection.” And if you don’t want to watch the whole thing, VideoGamerTV made a helpful <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJDn0jRnUQ">abridged version of the conference</a> that has basically everything that’s important in it.</p>
<p>33:00 – We discuss the closure of Civilization World and what it can tell us about the state of Social Games, and how it compares to a similar collapse of the MMO space.</p>
<p>48:00 – Crytek jumps on the free-to-play bandwagon and is also very bad at naming things. We also talk about Cevat Yerli’s <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/28/crytek-reveals-the-many-faces-of-free-to-play?">statement</a> that “…the notion of a single-player experience has to go away.”</p>
<p>1:02:15 – Round Table Discussion: Are the Elder Scrolls games getting better or worse?</p>
<p>1:18:00 – We round out the podcast with the Assassin’s Creed 4 announcement. I hope you like pirates, because… uh… well I’m not really sure where the hell they’re going with this. Assassins and pirates? Are we going to finally see a video game about pirates versus ninjas? I don’t know, but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3jKH5peHt8">here’s the announcement trailer.</a></p>

<li>Whatcha doooin’? Josh is dealing with life stuff. Chris is playing <a href="http://www.gog.com/gamecard/system_shock_2">System Shock 2 from Good Old Games OH MY GOSH SO HAPPY</a>. And also <a href="http://www.gog.com/gamecard/daikatana">Daikatana</a>. Rutskarn is still playing <em>Far Cry 3: Cry Some More</em> and <a href="http://www.antichamber-game.com/">Antichamber</a>. And I’m still playing Minecraft using the <a href="http://www.technicpack.net/tekkit/">Tekkit Launcher</a>.
</li><li>Here is the trailer for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=WGLHLylUZFw">Star Trek: Flying A Space-Gun Through SPAAAACE Edition</a>.
</li><li>Note that this story about how <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/article/68576/electronic-arts-focusing-on-hits">EA is Focusing on “fewer titles” going into the next generation</a> is actually from 2011. But it talks about stuff that’s ongoing at EA. So the news is still relevant and worth discussing, just… old.
</li><li>Hey, did you know it’s <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/female-gears-of-war-protagonist-hard-to-justify-says-epic-6403996">unprofitable to have women as game protagonists</a>? As Rutskarn pointed out, this may be because they get <a href="http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/games-with-female-heroes-dont-sell-because-publishers-dont-support-them">half the marketing budget</a>.
</li><li>Here is a link to the <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/unskippable/656-X-Blades">Unskippable riff on the X-Blades intro</a>. My goodness was she nails-on-a-chalkboard awful. I mean, vapid, stupid humiliating pandering outfit, screechy voice, plastic face, completely uninteresting. Both of my daughters latched onto her. Not because she was a good character, but because it was the first time they’d been able to play as a female in an action game. The game lost some of its appeal when they realized she wasn’t wearing orange pants and they were staring at her bare ass.
</li><li>Here is <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/reviews/anime/6657-Anime-Review-Devil-May-Cry">Josh’s review of the Devil May Cry anime</a> on the Escapist.
</li><li><a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/colonial-marines-failure-why-it-may-be-impossible-to-recreate-james-cameron">Here’s the Ben Kuchera article</a> on making Aliens into a game. Which incidentally led to <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/experienced-points/10205-Aliens-Isnt-About-Shooting-Aliens?utm_source=features&amp;utm_medium=index_carousel&amp;utm_campaign=all">my Escapist column for this week</a>. I’ll give it a post of its own tomorrow, so if you want to respond to my article you might want to wait until then. Or not. Do what you like. I’m not your mum.
</li><li>Here is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0S7PLCqr8I">Two Best Friends Play System Shock 2</a>.
</li><li>We each pitch our own Aliens game. In the end, I think we conclude we’re awesome and someone should give us millions of dollars to make a game.

<p>Housekeeping:</p>
<p><strong>Oh my gosh is the message-clipping pissing me off.</strong> To be clear, this is a bug that I’ve confirmed in Vent, which has existed for YEARS. If you record something long (like an hour and a half or more) then when you export the audio files it will randomly chop off the end of messages. That’s not us letting go of the push-to-talk button early. That’s vent being stupid. You can listen to the conversation in Vent and it sounds fine, but after export you get what you hear in the Diecast. So much rage.</p>
<p>You might suggest Mumble. Josh says Mumble sounds horrible. I wouldn’t know. I grew up in the 70’s and I thought 8-track players and cassette tapes sounded just dandy, and when compact disks came along I couldn’t even detect the increase in quality. </p>
<p>I’ve been a guest on a lot of different podcasts over the years, and they all use Skype. The thing is, <strong>I friggin hate Skype</strong>. It’s this obnoxious, clingy, self-important jackass of a program that’s constantly bouncing up and down in the system tray and begging for attention. You always need to go through multiple warning dialogs to get it to close, to the point where it’s actually more convenient to just kill it with task manager rather than listen to it go hysterical and warn me that I won’t be able to receive calls. Whenever I need Skype for doing a guest appearance I install it, do the spot, and then un-install it again. The thing reminds me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealPlayer#Controversies" title="Wikipedia">RealPlayer circa 1998</a>.  </p>
<p>Still, we’re working on making the show suck less.</p>
