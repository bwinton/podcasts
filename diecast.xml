      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The number one requested feature for the show is an RSS feed for the podcast that handles the audio tagging properly.

I don’t use RSS and I can’t comment on how compatible / reliable / useful / accurate it is. It’s hosted off-site and I don’t know anything about it other than:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It exists.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems to work for everyone who has tried it so far.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for putting that together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosts:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/trollface-coolface-problem&quot;&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale&quot;&gt;Sham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chocolatehammer.org/&quot;&gt;Puns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalmumbles.com/&quot; title=&quot;MUMBLES!&quot;&gt;Cannibal Wrestling&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Regret&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show notes:&lt;span id=&quot;more-23295&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;01:00 Chris talks about a movie.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently &lt;a href=&quot;?p=336&quot;&gt;Do it Again, Stupid&lt;/a&gt; is now &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_of_Tomorrow_(film)&quot; title=&quot;Edge of Tomorrow&quot;&gt;a movie&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:00 Just kidding. That last section was just us arguing about groundhog(s) for no good reason. NOW we’re talking about Edge of Tomorrow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw61gCe2oqI&quot;&gt;Here’s a trailer, if you’re interested.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6:00 Chris played Among the Sleep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krillbite.com/ats/&quot;&gt;Official site.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12:00 Rutskarn is playing The Walking Dead: Season 2.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discussion is spoiler-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20:00 Mumbles is upset about what happened to the Shield.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;&gt;these guys&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shield_(professional_wrestling)&quot;&gt;These guys&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;29:30 Mumbles and Chris talk Mario Kart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;37:00 Shamus has Played Wolfenstein: The New Order.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My column (should go up on Tuesday) is about the game. The question of “Is this Jewish conspiracy offensive or not?” is likely to be a touchy one. This is a sensitive subject handled in a very broad-strokes game, and it’s probably not particularly useful to get enraged at people who feel too much or too little outrage relative to yours. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/columns/criticalintel/11570-Wolfenstein-and-the-Power-of-Resistance&quot; title=&quot;Critical Intel: Wolfenstein and the Power of Resistance&quot;&gt;Robert Rath had a column last week&lt;/a&gt; where he came down strongly on the “This is not okay” side of the argument. I didn’t like the idea when I heard it, but when I saw it in the game I was basically willing to go along with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;58:00 Josh had an X-Man movie marathon!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talk about the early X-Men movies, the latest X-Men movie, and the X-Men comics. This conversation was really confusing and hard for me to follow, but I think there are &lt;em&gt;Days of Future Past&lt;/em&gt; spoilers in there. Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve never figured out how to do this in WordPress without importing ridiculous podcasting contraptions or crawling down into the guts of WordPress to do it myself. But! Someone has set one up for us. I don’t use RSS and I can’t comment on how compatible / reliable / useful / accurate it is. It’s hosted off-site and I don’t know anything about it other than:

It exists.Seems to work for everyone who has tried it so far.

Thanks for putting that together.

Hosts: Josh, Sham, Puns, Cannibal Wrestling, and Regret.

Show notes:

01:00 Chris talks about a movie.

Apparently Do it Again, Stupid is now a movie?

4:00 Just kidding. That last section was just us arguing about groundhog(s) for no good reason. NOW we’re talking about Edge of Tomorrow.

Here’s a trailer, if you’re interested.

6:00 Chris played Among the Sleep.

Official site.

12:00 Rutskarn is playing The Walking Dead: Season 2.

This discussion is spoiler-free.

20:00 Mumbles is upset about what happened to the Shield.

Not these guys. These guys.

29:30 Mumbles and Chris talk Mario Kart.

37:00 Shamus has Played Wolfenstein: The New Order.

My column (should go up on Tuesday) is about the game. The question of “Is this Jewish conspiracy offensive or not?” is likely to be a touchy one. This is a sensitive subject handled in a very broad-strokes game, and it’s probably not particularly useful to get enraged at people who feel too much or too little outrage relative to yours.

I didn’t like the idea when I heard it, but when I saw it in the game I was basically willing to go along with it.

58:00 Josh had an X-Man movie marathon!

We talk about the early X-Men movies, the latest X-Men movie, and the X-Men comics. This conversation was really confusing and hard for me to follow, but I think there are Days of Future Past spoilers in there. Maybe.

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We’re proud to present this hour of podcast, which is completely free of anyone talking about Dark Souls. You’re welcome. However, I now own Dark Souls, so one of these days we’re going to have &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; conversation. You have not gained your freedom. Only a reprieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show notes: &lt;span id=&quot;more-23244&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1:00 Shamus is Playing Wolfenstein: The New Order.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m only a couple of hours in and don’t have anything to say about it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:30 Josh is looking into video editing software.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is Chris. And Shamus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14:30 Mumbles talks about how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2014/05/27/nintendo-revenue-sharing/&quot;&gt;Nintendo has decided to take a cut of let’s plays and streamers.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should have pointed out: Lots of streamers and LP-ers are moving to Flattr, PayPal, and Patreon. What happens when everyone is posting ad-free videos and there’s nothing for Nintendo to take? How is YouTube going to respond to this move that indirectly makes their service even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; unprofitable by encouraging us peasants to not monetize?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could get strange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23:00 Mumbles is playing Transistor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25:30 Chris is playing Watch_Dogs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30:00 LUDONARRATIVE DISSONANCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aw yeah. That’s the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;37:00 Chris is now the proud&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;But not really.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; owner of an Xbox One.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;44:00 MAILBAG!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Show notes:

1:30 Chris talks about Wolfenstein: The New Order

Here are the Polygon articles Chris mentioned:

Wolfenstein is the rare game that shows sex as both fun and healing

Wolfenstein: The New Order shows you the horror of concentration camps from the first-person.

16:00 Shamus had a fight with Google.

The post is down until I get this sorted out, although you can see the original text here. You can decide for yourself if that qualifies as outrageous adult content. For contrast, here is the Call of Roma ad that was repeatedly deemed okay by Google under the same standards. Which means Google was regularly putting stuff on my site that was – by any reasonable measure – far more offensive than what they banned me for. And in both cases I was denied any way to tell them their system was malfunctioning.

Running a Patreon campaign is a big deal for me. It’s going to take me a little while to set it up. I’ll talk more about this once I figure out what I’m doing.

28:00 A digression on various obnoxious / annoying / “evil” internet companies, from Google to Amazon.

This is what made me dislike Amazon, and question if our patent system does objectively more damage than good in the world.

39:00 Mumbles talks about Bombshell and female characters created by female designers.

49:00 Shamus and Mumble hijack things and talk comics for a bit.

We talk about Punisher, Dr. Strange, and The Superior Foes of Spider-Man. Tragically, TSFoSM isn’t yet available on Marvel Unlimited. At least, I think it isn’t. Their search functionality and catalog indexing is atrocious.

EDIT: I found it. Their own search engine was useless. Google took me right to it.

54:00 Chris and Josh talk about Transistor.

&lt;p&gt;The whole thing eventually degrades into yet another ride on the “what do we REALLY think of Duke Nukem?” rollercoaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25:00 DARK SOULS 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you only listen to one 80′s sitcom-style song about Dark Souls 2, make sure it’s THIS one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30:00 If one Marvel hero was set up on a blind date with one DC hero, what would be the most interesting pairing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;35:00 Talking about Dark Souls 2 again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;48:00 Shamus and Mumbles talk comic books.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Show notes:

1:30 Bombshell

Behold the Bombshell site, in all its kitschy glory. Maybe they’re serious. Maybe it’s ironic. It’s definitely unapologetic.

The whole thing eventually degrades into yet another ride on the “what do we REALLY think of Duke Nukem?” rollercoaster.

25:00 DARK SOULS 2

If you only listen to one 80′s sitcom-style song about Dark Souls 2, make sure it’s THIS one!

30:00 If one Marvel hero was set up on a blind date with one DC hero, what would be the most interesting pairing?

35:00 Talking about Dark Souls 2 again.

48:00 Shamus and Mumbles talk comic books.

1:03:00 Mumbles is playing Diablo III for Xbox.

Show notes:

0:30 Josh is playing Dark Souls 2. Still!

Yes, we’re having the “Dark Souls isn’t hard it’s punishing except what does that really mean and let’s compare it to other hard games.” talk again. I feel like we gnawed that bone to the marrow last time around, so if that discussion happens again I’m probably going to sit it out.

22:00 Shamus has been been reading Marvel Comics!

Titles read: Guardians of the Galaxy. Astonishing X-Men. Ultimate Spider-Man. Little bit of Punisher. Random samplings of Deadpool and classic Spider-Man.

Here is the FILM CRIT HULK SMASH AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2. Here is MovieBob’s review.

35:00 Rutskarn is working on Unrest and his tabletop RPGs.

Unrest is not available for pre-order on Steam, but it has a Steam page anyway. So that’s cool. Also, Chocolate Hammer might be revived soon. Cross your fingers.

55:00 Rutskarn shares some of the experimental tabletop games he’s been playing.

1:05:00 Chris has been playing Civilization. All of them.

Outro: Slamba Yetu.

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t on the show this week because I was sick and had…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[two paragraphs of lengthy bitching and moaning redacted]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…until it all turned green and fell off. But I’m nearly back to normal now. In the meantime, the kids did the show without me. I’m listening to the show for the first time as I write this, so we’re going to experience this together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosts: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesonwhiskey.com/us/agegate&quot;&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chocolatehammer.org/&quot;&gt;Rutskarn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalmumbles.com/&quot;&gt;Mumbles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-22938&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:00 Chris has entered the strange world of mobile gaming. He’s playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gameloft.com/mobile-games/jurassic-park/&quot;&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really? The game is just called “Jurassic Park”? Not “Jurassic Park: Mobile” or “Jurassic Park: Reviving Previously Extinct Species to have them Fight to the Death in a sick and Decadent Pit-Fight in the Name of Animal Cruelty Because Obviously”? Nothing to distinguish it from the movie, or the hundreds of other games that have also failed to do justice to the Jurassic Park mythos? No?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:00 Chris is playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://rustysrealdealbaseball.nintendo.com/&quot;&gt;Rusty’s Real Deal Baseball&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18:30 Mumbles has been learning The Console Gaming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, she’s been playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Defense_Force_2017&quot;&gt;Earth Defense Force 2017&lt;/a&gt;. After that she’s going to play &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asura&#x27;s_Wrath&quot;&gt;Asura’s Wrath&lt;/a&gt;, which I gather is a videogame of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;29:00 Apparently we digressed into Hearthstone at some point? That’s the new card game thing, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32:00 Josh is playing Dark Souls 2 and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strongholdkingdoms.com/&quot;&gt;Stronghold Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;40:00 Rutskarn is playing Planescape Torment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record: Yes, I played through Planescape Torment. You lightweights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;48:00 The Star Wars Extended Universe is not recognized as canon by Disney.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not surprised by this. J.J. Abrams rebooted ALL OF STAR TREK, and I suspect it was partly because he didn’t want to have to do a hundred hours of research every time someone pushed a button in the movie. He’s not my first choice for either franchise, and he’s never going to give us a &lt;em&gt;Wrath of Khan&lt;/em&gt; or an &lt;em&gt;Empire Strikes Back&lt;/em&gt;. But in my book he’s like Michael Bay except he knows to to make a movie. It might be cheap, disposable entertainment, but at least it holds together as a cohesive story with proper character beats. And I’ll take ridiculous LENS FLARE over incomprehensible, puke-inducing shaky-cam any day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hang on. After I typed that last paragraph I remembered that Abrams just made Star Trek Into Darkness, and it &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; try to re-create Wrath of Khan, and it &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; a cohesive story at all. I haven’t watched it, but that’s what I heard, anyway. Did I just bolster my position before destroying it? I don’t know. I report. You deride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANYWAY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be for the best. Abrams strikes me as not the best person to manage the intersection of dozens of films and books. He’s not a detail guy, and he would probably just infuriate fans if he actually tried to build on existing extended universe canon. It’s far better for him to be up front and honest about what he’s doing so we can go in with our expectations properly calibrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:00:00 Shouldn’t the show be about over by now? Are we still talking about Star Wars? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NERDS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:03:00 Josh isn’t kidding. &lt;a href=&quot;http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ice_Cream_Maker_Guy&quot;&gt;Here is the guy with the ice cream maker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, still talking about Star Wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:08:00 We’re talking about Guy Fieri now. For some reason.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no idea who &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fieri&quot;&gt;this guy&lt;/a&gt; was until Chris brought him up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Star Wars and Homestuck and Guy Fieri?!? What is happening?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, there is Homestuck spoilers in this segment. Whatever THAT means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:11:00 CURSE YOU JOSH!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/gmjSnF6?tags&quot; title=&quot;Swagraven&quot;&gt;Here is the image&lt;/a&gt; Rutskarn shared at the end of the show. You’re… welcome?&lt;/p&gt;

      <itunes:summary>I wasn’t on the show this week because I was sick and had…

[two paragraphs of lengthy bitching and moaning redacted]

…until it all turned green and fell off. But I’m nearly back to normal now. In the meantime, the kids did the show without me. I’m listening to the show for the first time as I write this, so we’re going to experience this together.

Let’s do this:

Hosts: Josh, Rutskarn, Chris, and Mumbles.

Show notes:

2:00 Chris has entered the strange world of mobile gaming. He’s playing Jurassic Park.

Really? The game is just called “Jurassic Park”? Not “Jurassic Park: Mobile” or “Jurassic Park: Reviving Previously Extinct Species to have them Fight to the Death in a sick and Decadent Pit-Fight in the Name of Animal Cruelty Because Obviously”? Nothing to distinguish it from the movie, or the hundreds of other games that have also failed to do justice to the Jurassic Park mythos? No?

Okay then.

9:00 Chris is playing Rusty’s Real Deal Baseball.

18:30 Mumbles has been learning The Console Gaming.

Specifically, she’s been playing Earth Defense Force 2017. After that she’s going to play Asura’s Wrath, which I gather is a videogame of some sort.

29:00 Apparently we digressed into Hearthstone at some point? That’s the new card game thing, right?

32:00 Josh is playing Dark Souls 2 and Stronghold Kingdoms.

40:00 Rutskarn is playing Planescape Torment.

For the record: Yes, I played through Planescape Torment. You lightweights.

48:00 The Star Wars Extended Universe is not recognized as canon by Disney.

I am not surprised by this. J.J. Abrams rebooted ALL OF STAR TREK, and I suspect it was partly because he didn’t want to have to do a hundred hours of research every time someone pushed a button in the movie. He’s not my first choice for either franchise, and he’s never going to give us a Wrath of Khan or an Empire Strikes Back. But in my book he’s like Michael Bay except he knows to to make a movie. It might be cheap, disposable entertainment, but at least it holds together as a cohesive story with proper character beats. And I’ll take ridiculous LENS FLARE over incomprehensible, puke-inducing shaky-cam any day.

Hang on. After I typed that last paragraph I remembered that Abrams just made Star Trek Into Darkness, and it did try to re-create Wrath of Khan, and it wasn’t a cohesive story at all. I haven’t watched it, but that’s what I heard, anyway. Did I just bolster my position before destroying it? I don’t know. I report. You deride.

ANYWAY.

This might be for the best. Abrams strikes me as not the best person to manage the intersection of dozens of films and books. He’s not a detail guy, and he would probably just infuriate fans if he actually tried to build on existing extended universe canon. It’s far better for him to be up front and honest about what he’s doing so we can go in with our expectations properly calibrated.

1:00:00 Shouldn’t the show be about over by now? Are we still talking about Star Wars?

NERDS!

1:03:00 Josh isn’t kidding. Here is the guy with the ice cream maker.

Also, still talking about Star Wars.

1:08:00 We’re talking about Guy Fieri now. For some reason.

I had no idea who this guy was until Chris brought him up.

Star Wars and Homestuck and Guy Fieri?!? What is happening?

Also, there is Homestuck spoilers in this segment. Whatever THAT means.

1:11:00 CURSE YOU JOSH!

Here is the image Rutskarn shared at the end of the show. You’re… welcome?

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Hey, guys, it’s Rutskarn. This story speaks for itself–it’s about a total shitshow of a GM who ran the most incompetent campaign I’ve ever participated in. It is not the worst campaign I’ve ever &lt;i&gt;heard&lt;/i&gt; of, but to clear that hurdle it’d need to involve literal felonies, so never mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosts: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesonwhiskey.com/us/agegate&quot;&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chocolatehammer.org/&quot;&gt;Rutskarn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale&quot;&gt;Shamus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in case your palate needs scrubbing, I’ll be around to answer any questions about running or playing tabletop roleplaying games that you’ve got for me in the comments. I’ve got hundreds of hours of GMing experience (in fact, nearly a hundred hours of experience GMing &lt;em&gt;only at charity events&lt;/em&gt;), so generally speaking I know what I’m talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask whatever you’d like. I should get to most of them within a day or so, but I’ll plug away until I’ve hit ‘em all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much to special guest George Weidman of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWqr2tH3dPshNhPjV5h1xRw&quot;&gt;SuperBunnyHop&lt;/a&gt; for joining in. He’s also going to be part of Spoiler Warning this week. If you’re going to check out his channel (which you should totally do) I highly recommend his video on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxR__N0_is&quot;&gt;Quiet Time&lt;/a&gt; in games, and if you’re obsessed with VR like I am then you’ll want to see his fairly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2myY_pQEMk&quot;&gt;thorough VR report from GDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosts: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesonwhiskey.com/us/agegate&quot;&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chocolatehammer.org/&quot;&gt;Rutskarn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalmumbles.com/&quot;&gt;Mumbles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/bunnyhopshow&quot; title=&quot;SuperBunnyHop on YouTube&quot;&gt;George Weidman (SuperBunnyHop)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale&quot;&gt;Shamus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-22856&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:00 Chris is playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redlynx.com/games/trials-fusion&quot;&gt;Trials Fusion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:00 Chris is also playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infamous_Second_Son&quot;&gt;Infamous: Second Son&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12:00 Talking about morality systems, and George brings up &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_(video_game)&quot;&gt;the Witcher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19:30 Let’s Talk about HOT MEN.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re actually talking about this Gamasutra Article: &lt;a href=&quot;http://gamasutra.com/blogs/JaneJensen/20140414/215473/WRITING_HOT_MEN_FOR_GAMES_Yes_please.php&quot;&gt;WRITING HOT MEN FOR GAMES? Yes, please&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Jensen&quot;&gt;Jane Jensen&lt;/a&gt;, designer and creative force behind the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Knight&quot;&gt;Gabriel Knight&lt;/a&gt; series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows is nearly fifteen minutes where four straight men and a straight woman try to figure out which dudes are hot. Spoiler: &lt;em&gt;The Straight Men aren’t very good at this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32:00 Who is Dennis Hopper?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often feign outrage for comedic effect, but I was actually stunned silent when the guys described &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000454/&quot;&gt;DENNIS HOPPER&lt;/a&gt; as “the guy who played King Koopa”.  Someday someone fifteen years younger than you will describe Liam Neeson as “the guy from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1821658/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_11&quot;&gt;Nut Job&lt;/a&gt;” and you will know my pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;38:00 Mumbles is reading comics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mumbles explained, digital comics are a thing. At &lt;a href=&quot;http://marvel.com/comics/unlimited&quot;&gt;Marvel Unlimited&lt;/a&gt; you can pay $10 a month and read all the comics. New ones, old ones, everything. I’m seriously thinking about getting this for a month. Anyone use this service? I’d love to hear more about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;46:00 Rutskarn shows up, and then Shamus and Mumbles talk about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildstar-online.com/en/&quot;&gt;Wildstar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again to George for joining in.&lt;/p&gt;

      <itunes:summary>Thanks so much to special guest George Weidman of SuperBunnyHop for joining in. He’s also going to be part of Spoiler Warning this week. If you’re going to check out his channel (which you should totally do) I highly recommend his video on Quiet Time in games, and if you’re obsessed with VR like I am then you’ll want to see his fairly thorough VR report from GDC.

Hosts: Josh, Rutskarn, Chris, Mumbles, George Weidman (SuperBunnyHop), and Shamus.

Show notes:

1:00 Chris is playing Trials Fusion.

7:00 Chris is also playing Infamous: Second Son.

12:00 Talking about morality systems, and George brings up the Witcher.

19:30 Let’s Talk about HOT MEN.

We’re actually talking about this Gamasutra Article: WRITING HOT MEN FOR GAMES? Yes, please by Jane Jensen, designer and creative force behind the Gabriel Knight series.

What follows is nearly fifteen minutes where four straight men and a straight woman try to figure out which dudes are hot. Spoiler: The Straight Men aren’t very good at this.

32:00 Who is Dennis Hopper?

We often feign outrage for comedic effect, but I was actually stunned silent when the guys described DENNIS HOPPER as “the guy who played King Koopa”.  Someday someone fifteen years younger than you will describe Liam Neeson as “the guy from Nut Job” and you will know my pain.

38:00 Mumbles is reading comics.

As Mumbles explained, digital comics are a thing. At Marvel Unlimited you can pay $10 a month and read all the comics. New ones, old ones, everything. I’m seriously thinking about getting this for a month. Anyone use this service? I’d love to hear more about it.

46:00 Rutskarn shows up, and then Shamus and Mumbles talk about Wildstar.

Thanks again to George for joining in.

&lt;p&gt;Show notes:&lt;span id=&quot;more-22813&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:20 Josh is playing FTL: Advanced Edition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;?p=17335&quot; title=&quot;FTL: Random vs. Skill&quot;&gt;My write-up on FTL is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:00 Chris is playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbheiGx0-A&quot;&gt;Disney Magical World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13:00 Chris is also playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qsdIveYJ0Y&quot;&gt;Actual Sunlight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting that this is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.depressionquest.com/&quot;&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; game about depression I’ve run into in the last few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal talk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve had days where I woke up and found I couldn’t feel joy or happiness or even contentment. Where nothing felt worth doing. The usual fire I had to consume and talk about games (or do anything else) was just… &lt;em&gt;gone&lt;/em&gt;. There was never any reason for this. Everything was fine in my life, aside from the fact that my mood was unaccountably mis-calibrated. I don’t know that this is anything like the clinical depression that some people talk about, but I use it as a frame of reference. My episodes always blow over after a few days and don’t linger for weeks or months on end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether this is depression or not, it’s certainly an interesting phenomena. We tend to assume that our moods are linked to our situations, and it can be completely baffling and frustrating when that connection is broken. &lt;em&gt;I have no reason to be sad right now. So why am I sad?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having never played either game myself, I do wonder what the intent behind them is. Are they a way for people suffering from depression to feel some sort of connection with each other? Is this a way of saying “You are not alone” to others? Or is this intended to share the experience with people who have never been through it and don’t understand what it’s like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I’d asked Chris during the show, but I’d love to hear from anyone who has played either game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15:00 Shamus is working on programming. But not Good Robot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuff I’m working on / thinking about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) GLSL shading language. 2) Systems which are incredibly robust with regards to consistency of framerate. 3) Different techniques for offloading CPU work onto the graphics card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we’ll talk about this later in the week. Maybe not. I still need to finish my write-up on Thief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16:00 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.civilization.com/#trailer&quot;&gt;Civilization: Beyond Earth&lt;/a&gt; has been announced. So we spend a bunch of time talking about Alpha Centauri.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This topic gets derailed by religion in games. If you want to skip that, jump ahead to somewhere around the 37 minute mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26:00 Surprise mid-podcast mailbag!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;34:00 We talk about Jade Empire.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;37:00 And back to Civilization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;44:00 Mailbag!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing question. I’d already been thinking about this it for a while when the question showed up, so I had a lot to say about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ninja-blues.com/&quot;&gt;Let me plug Jarenth here while I have an excuse.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Show notes:

1:20 Josh is playing FTL: Advanced Edition.

My write-up on FTL is here.

8:00 Chris is playing Disney Magical World

13:00 Chris is also playing Actual Sunlight.

Interesting that this is the second game about depression I’ve run into in the last few months.

Personal talk:

I’ve had days where I woke up and found I couldn’t feel joy or happiness or even contentment. Where nothing felt worth doing. The usual fire I had to consume and talk about games (or do anything else) was just… gone. There was never any reason for this. Everything was fine in my life, aside from the fact that my mood was unaccountably mis-calibrated. I don’t know that this is anything like the clinical depression that some people talk about, but I use it as a frame of reference.

Regardless of whether this is depression or not, it’s certainly an interesting phenomena. We tend to assume that our moods are linked to our situations, and it can be completely baffling and frustrating when that connection is broken. I have no reason to be sad right now. So why am I sad?

Having never played either game myself, I do wonder what the intent behind them is. Are they a way for people suffering from depression to feel some sort of connection with each other? Is this a way of saying “You are not alone” to others? Or is this intended to share the experience with people who have never been through it and don’t understand what it’s like?

I wish I’d asked Chris during the show, but I’d love to hear from anyone who has played either game.

15:00 Shamus is working on programming. But not Good Robot.

Stuff I’m working on / thinking about:

1) GLSL shading language. 2) Systems which are incredibly robust with regards to consistency of framerate. 3) Different techniques for offloading CPU work onto the graphics card.

Maybe we’ll talk about this later in the week. Maybe not. I still need to finish my write-up on Thief.

16:00 Civilization: Beyond Earth has been announced. So we spend a bunch of time talking about Alpha Centauri.

This topic gets derailed by religion in games. If you want to skip that, jump ahead to somewhere around the 37 minute mark.

26:00 Surprise mid-podcast mailbag!

34:00 We talk about Jade Empire.

37:00 And back to Civilization.

44:00 Mailbag!

Amazing question. I’d already been thinking about this it for a while when the question showed up, so I had a lot to say about it.

Let me plug Jarenth here while I have an excuse.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-22773&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:00 Christopher is playing Goat Simulator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvWGLcdI8o8&quot;&gt;Goat Simulator trailer&lt;/a&gt;, which is a send-up of the infamous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZqrG1bdGtg&quot;&gt;Dead Island trailer&lt;/a&gt;. And I’m pretty sure this is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEJHrmliVQw&quot;&gt;Farming Simulator Joke&lt;/a&gt; Jarenth was taking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:00 Joshua is still playing Dark Souls.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17:00 Joshua also played BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea DLC. Both of them. Together.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;31:00 Dr. Jarenth has been playing Netrunner.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shutupandsitdown.com/blog/post/test/&quot;&gt;Leigh Alexander piece on Netrunner&lt;/a&gt;, which is what got both Chris and Jarenth interested in it. Also, he’s been playing a bit of &lt;a href=&quot;http://knucklecracker.com/blog/index.php/tag/creeper-world-3/&quot;&gt;Creeper World 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;35:00 Shamus is playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraria.org/&quot;&gt;Terraria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;38:00 Shamus and Josh talk about Archer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/FXArcher&quot;&gt;Archer YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, to give you an idea of what the show looks like. Note that in the latest season they’ve abandoned the spy motif for a Miami Vice motif. Haven’t seen it yet myself. Netflix releases typically lag behind broadcast television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;42:00 MAILBAG!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite question in ages. It turns out all of us have dabbled in game development. Also I talk a bit about the programming I’ve been doing lately.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Chris was at GDC this week. Mumbles couldn’t make it. This means no Spoiler Warning. It also means the Diecast is a little lighter than usual. But! We’ll have a special GDC-focused Diecast later this week. In the meantime, here is your weekly dose of NERD:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosts: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chocolatehammer.org/&quot;&gt;Rutskarn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(Internet)&quot;&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale&quot;&gt;Shamus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0:30 Rutskarn is playing Alpha Protocol.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, no discussion of Alpha Protocol is complete without mentioning the Disclosure Alert LP:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’ll repeat my suggestion here: We need a term for the “first ten minutes of Morrowind” problem. The thing where an otherwise engaging title has a horrible and off-putting intro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26:00 Josh is still playing Dark Souls.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;38:00 Rutskarn answers Diecast mailbag question from last week, “What game would you give to a different developer?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here we launch into a discussion of LA Noire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;42:00 Shamus is still playing Path of Exile.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;45:00 MAILBAG!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1) How do you feel about cheat codes and what are your favorites?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get into a really interesting conversation about what happens when the player hits a frustration point and how they respond when they overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2) Roughly: What’s the difference between good DLC and bad DLC?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3) Do you think the relative shortage of female protagonists has anything to do with the additional difficulty of animating hair?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under no circumstances will we be discussing feminism this week. I know this kind of strayed a tiny bit close to that, but let’s not do it. Nothing could possibly be said this week that wasn’t said last week. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <itunes:summary>Chris was at GDC this week. Mumbles couldn’t make it. This means no Spoiler Warning. It also means the Diecast is a little lighter than usual. But! We’ll have a special GDC-focused Diecast later this week. In the meantime, here is your weekly dose of NERD:

Hosts: Rutskarn, Josh, and Shamus.

Show notes:

0:30 Rutskarn is playing Alpha Protocol.

Of course, no discussion of Alpha Protocol is complete without mentioning the Disclosure Alert LP:

And I’ll repeat my suggestion here: We need a term for the “first ten minutes of Morrowind” problem. The thing where an otherwise engaging title has a horrible and off-putting intro.

26:00 Josh is still playing Dark Souls.

38:00 Rutskarn answers Diecast mailbag question from last week, “What game would you give to a different developer?”

From here we launch into a discussion of LA Noire.

42:00 Shamus is still playing Path of Exile.

45:00 MAILBAG!

1) How do you feel about cheat codes and what are your favorites?

We get into a really interesting conversation about what happens when the player hits a frustration point and how they respond when they overcome it.

2) Roughly: What’s the difference between good DLC and bad DLC?

3) Do you think the relative shortage of female protagonists has anything to do with the additional difficulty of animating hair?

Under no circumstances will we be discussing feminism this week. I know this kind of strayed a tiny bit close to that, but let’s not do it. Nothing could possibly be said this week that wasn’t said last week.

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;So let’s have a nice, calm, non-controversial week talking abo- &lt;em&gt;aw damn it someone mentioned feminism again, didn’t they?&lt;/em&gt; Let me get my crash helmet on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosts: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chocolatehammer.org/&quot;&gt;Rutskarn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalmumbles.com/&quot;&gt;Mumbles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelly_bean&quot;&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale&quot;&gt;Shamus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mild spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12:00 OOPS FEMINISM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to stop talking about this subject once you get started. For me the compelling thing is the completely anarchic and asymmetrical nature of the debate. This isn’t a two-sided war between people who want female protagonists and people who don’t. This is a multi-faceted debate where extremists tend to get the most attention. There are a lot of different types of “feminists” (who might not even self-identify as feminists&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;I don&#x27;t self-identify as one, but I&#x27;ve been called one. Labels are dangerous things and the LAST thing I want is another argument over what the word &quot;feminist&quot; means.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) who just want more female protagonists. Then there are angry people who think that sexy characters are inherently destructive and that enjoying some T&amp;amp;A makes you a horrible person. Then the other side fails to draw a distinction between these two positions and hilarity ensues. Add in a handful of really ugly, Angry Young Men who spew hate and threats. Then have the feminist side&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;And remember, this side is actually several sides that don&#x27;t all self-identify as feminist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; paint all of the opposition as if they were in league with – and sympathetic to – the Angry Young Men. Add in a couple of layers of counter-backlash to either side and suddenly it’s really hard to understand how such a simple idea can generate so much outrage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This complete mayhem creates a desire from people like me to clear up this confusion. Maybe I can’t settle the debate, but maybe I can at least help the various sides understand the complexity of the conflict? But no. My efforts never help and I just end up being yet another idealistic idiot shouting into the storm. And so it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rutskarn mentioned this post from &lt;a href=&quot;http://susanarendt.com/2014/03/04/why-titanfalls-launch-trailer-made-me-emotional/&quot;&gt;Susan Arendt on the Titanfall trailer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also talk about women being integrated into the US Navy. This is such a sad topic for me. There are a lot more anecdotes like the one I told. The problem is that the whole subject is dripping with politics, and even people doing the right things are often doing them in the wrong way and for the wrong reasons. For reference, these events happened around 1991 through 1993. (My brother was in boot camp when the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailhook_scandal&quot;&gt;Tailhook scandal&lt;/a&gt; took place.) I don’t know how the Navy is doing these days, but the early days of co-ed service were a complete mess. I could fill several pages with stories about how completely dysfunctional the service was and about how ugly and unfair (to both genders) integration was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;36:00 Rutskarn is working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://pyrodactyl.com/&quot;&gt;Unrest&lt;/a&gt; and playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Protocol&quot;&gt;Alpha Protocol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;39:30 Chris is prepping for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gdconf.com/&quot;&gt;GDC&lt;/a&gt; and playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.titanfall.com/xbox-one?_o=42032312&amp;amp;utm_campaign=tf-search-us-pbm-g-brand-core-e&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_term=titanfall&amp;amp;sourceid=tf-search-us-pbm-g-brand-core-e&amp;amp;gclid=CLbW-vjVnL0CFSISMwodqE8ACw&quot;&gt;Titanfall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;48:00 Shamus is playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCWJUSulnro&quot;&gt;Borderlands 2&lt;/a&gt; again, and also playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pathofexile.com/&quot;&gt;Path of Exile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also we briefly discuss &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsQRvRAFk4&quot;&gt;Race the Sun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

12:00 OOPS FEMINISM

It’s hard to stop talking about this subject once you get started. For me the compelling thing is the completely anarchic and asymmetrical nature of the debate. This isn’t a two-sided war between people who want female protagonists and people who don’t. This is a multi-faceted debate where extremists tend to get the most attention. There are a lot of different types of “feminists” (who might not even self-identify as feminists[1]I don&#x27;t self-identify as one, but I&#x27;ve been called one. Labels are dangerous things and the LAST thing I want is another argument over what the word &quot;feminist&quot; means.) who just want more female protagonists. Then there are angry people who think that sexy characters are inherently destructive and that enjoying some T&amp;A makes you a horrible person. Then the other side fails to draw a distinction between these two positions and hilarity ensues. Add in a handful of really ugly, Angry Young Men who spew hate and threats. Then have the feminist side[2]And remember, this side is actually several sides that don&#x27;t all self-identify as feminist. paint all of the opposition as if they were in league with – and sympathetic to – the Angry Young Men. Add in a couple of layers of counter-backlash to either side and suddenly it’s really hard to understand how such a simple idea can generate so much outrage.

This complete mayhem creates a desire from people like me to clear up this confusion. Maybe I can’t settle the debate, but maybe I can at least help the various sides understand the complexity of the conflict? But no. My efforts never help and I just end up being yet another idealistic idiot shouting into the storm. And so it goes.

Rutskarn mentioned this post from Susan Arendt on the Titanfall trailer.

We also talk about women being integrated into the US Navy. This is such a sad topic for me. There are a lot more anecdotes like the one I told. The problem is that the whole subject is dripping with politics, and even people doing the right things are often doing them in the wrong way and for the wrong reasons.

I could fill several pages with stories about how completely dysfunctional the service was and about how ugly and unfair (to both genders) integration was.

36:00 Rutskarn is working on Unrest and playing Alpha Protocol.

39:30 Chris is prepping for GDC and playing Titanfall

48:00 Shamus is playing Borderlands 2 again, and also playing Path of Exile.

Also we briefly discuss Race the Sun.

55:30 Josh has begun playing The Walking Dead Season 2.

56:00 Josh is playing Dark Souls.

Here is the Dark Souls Critical Close-up Chris mentioned.

&lt;p&gt;For those of you you’ve never heard of it before, this is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catacomb_3-D&quot;&gt;Catacombs of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It pre-dates Wolfenstein, and is one of many games that competes for the murky title of “first FPS”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this segment we went off-topic and talked about oddball product tie-in games. I mentioned Chase the Chuckwagon. That’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_the_Chuck_Wagon&quot;&gt;a real game&lt;/a&gt; that’s a dog food product tie-in from 1983. My friend &lt;a href=&quot;?p=13053&quot; title=&quot;Autoblography Part 15: NERDS!&quot;&gt;David&lt;/a&gt; had a copy.

Hosts: Josh, Chris, and Shamus.

Show notes:

3:00 Shamus is playing Rise of the Triad

For those of you you’ve never heard of it before, this is Catacombs of the Abyss:

It pre-dates Wolfenstein, and is one of many games that competes for the murky title of “first FPS”.

7:00 Shamus is also playing Puzzle Quest: Galactrix

In this segment we went off-topic and talked about oddball product tie-in games. I mentioned Chase the Chuckwagon. That’s a real game that’s a dog food product tie-in from 1983. My friend David had a copy. Even though we were kids and the videogame industry was in its infancy, we were still able to recognize that the existence of the game was inherently preposterous.

Also mentioned: Avoid the Noid.

I’d never heard of Chex Quest until now.

14:30 Chris is playing Assassins Creed: Freedom Cry

22:30 Chris is playing Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare.

31:30 Josh shares a Project Zomboid anecdote.

39:00 MAIL TIME!

And yes, we answer several questions this week. These are good ones. Remember to send your questions in for next week. (Email in the banner at the top.)

TRIGGER WARNING: We discuss rare vs well-done steak, which to some people is a religious topic. For some reason.

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Here is an entire episode dedicated to a single game. Thief [4] has been a long time coming. Some have been excited to see it return. Some hopeful. Some outraged. Some resigned. But now we’ve played it and we can see the result for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the game we hoped for, but neither is it the train wreck we feared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosts: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt&quot;&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale&quot;&gt;Shamus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire show is about Thief, so no timestamps. We spoil some of the themes of the story during the show, but nothing that shouldn’t be incredibly obvious after the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the 57-minute mark we talk about the ending, so you might want to skip that part if you’re spoiler-averse.  Although as Chris says, the story is pretty much broken, and I don’t think spoilers will hurt you. And by “broken” I mean, “clearly a patchwork of different revisions of the story that don’t fit together or form a proper sequence of events”.&lt;/p&gt;

      <itunes:summary>As announced on the show, I’m vetting the diecast@shamusyoung.com emails now, and I’m going to try and be a little better about answering them. Also, we might use Diecast questions to fill slow moments in our Skyrim series. Protip: If you want the question to appear on the show, keep it short. Two or less sentences is ideal.

Hosts: Josh, Chris, and Shamus.

Show notes:

1:30 Chris has been playing Thief (1998) in preparation of playing Thief (2014).

5:00 Ken Levine and Irrational.

Here is the announcement, and here is the Leigh Alexander piece that Chris mentioned. (Protip: The latter is really good.)

27:00 Josh talks about Europa Universalis IV.

Specifically, we talk about the way the game portrays a world in which only Europe invented stuff.

44:00 Shamus talks about Assassins Creed: Black Flag.

Spoiler Warning: He’s not delighted.

&lt;p&gt;We also dig into the EA conversation again. Because that’s not getting old. We also discuss &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/195806/chasing_the_whale_examining_the_.php?print=1&quot;&gt;whales&lt;/a&gt;. I couldn’t find the promised link about how former EA boss John Riccitiello spent a lot of money on free-to-play games, but I did find &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-07-31-john-riccitiello-slams-opportunists-who-just-want-to-profit-from-games&quot;&gt;this interview from shortly after his departure&lt;/a&gt;, which came with this pull quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astonishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=22315&amp;amp;cpage=1#comment-364389&quot;&gt;Zidynnala found the quote I was looking for&lt;/a&gt;, along with some context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11:30 Mumbles is playing Candy Crush Saga!?!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://candyswipe.com/king.html&quot;&gt;Here is the statement from the creator of Candy Swipe&lt;/a&gt;. The guy made Candy Swipe in 2010. The King.com made a rip-off of the game in 2012. Then King trademarked “Candy”. Then they used the trademark to force Candy Swipe out of the market. That’s what’s been alleged, anyway. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/candycrush.asp&quot;&gt;Snopes has a good round-up of the story so far&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14:30 Mumbles is also playing Octodad.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21:00 Josh is playing The Banner Saga.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;34:00 Mumbles really likes the 3DS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.destructoid.com/review-the-starship-damrey-253991.phtml&quot;&gt;Starship Damrey&lt;/a&gt; game that Mumbles and Chris were talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;41:00 WHAT IS GOING ON?!?!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For thos eof you confused by the chaos, what happened is that Rutskarn lagged out. Ventrilo then queued up all of his chat over the space of 30 seconds and delivered it all at once. Not sure why Josh left that in, but there you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;42:00 Guise of the Wolf&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, the Total Biscuit video in question is still down. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFDF-OTvhNE&quot;&gt;But here is a copy uploaded by someone else&lt;/a&gt;.

      <itunes:summary>Hosts: Rutskarn, Mumbles, Josh, Chris, and Shamus.

Show Notes:

1:00 Shamus is playing Dungeon Keeper.

We also dig into the EA conversation again. Because that’s not getting old. We also discuss whales. I couldn’t find the promised link about how former EA boss John Riccitiello spent a lot of money on free-to-play games, but I did find this interview from shortly after his departure, which came with this pull quote:

Astonishing.

EDIT: Zidynnala found the quote I was looking for, along with some context.

11:30 Mumbles is playing Candy Crush Saga!?!

Here is the statement from the creator of Candy Swipe. The guy made Candy Swipe in 2010. The King.com made a rip-off of the game in 2012. Then King trademarked “Candy”. Then they used the trademark to force Candy Swipe out of the market. That’s what’s been alleged, anyway. Snopes has a good round-up of the story so far.

14:30 Mumbles is also playing Octodad.

21:00 Josh is playing The Banner Saga.

Here is a look at the fight between King.com and Banner Saga.

34:00 Mumbles really likes the 3DS.

Here is the Starship Damrey game that Mumbles and Chris were talking about.

41:00 WHAT IS GOING ON?!?!

For thos eof you confused by the chaos, what happened is that Rutskarn lagged out. Ventrilo then queued up all of his chat over the space of 30 seconds and delivered it all at once. Not sure why Josh left that in, but there you go.

42:00 Guise of the Wolf

As of this writing, the Total Biscuit video in question is still down. But here is a copy uploaded by someone else. It starts off looking just a little shabby, but if you stick with it you’ll see the problems go a lot deeper than bad art.

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This episode was recorded AFTER our &lt;a href=&quot;?page_id=16386&quot;&gt;Spoiler Warning&lt;/a&gt; session this week, but it’s being released first. We were a little tired and a couple of hosts short by the time we got to this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosts: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelly_bean&quot;&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale&quot;&gt;Shamus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show notes:&lt;span id=&quot;more-22170&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:00 Shamus is playing Elder Scrolls Online and EVE Online.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t talk about ESO yet. (Embargoed until Feburay 7th.) But we can talk about &lt;a href=&quot;http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/the-bloodbath-of-b-r5rb/&quot;&gt;the battle of B-R5RB&lt;/a&gt;. Note that we had this conversation before I did the homework for &lt;a href=&quot;?p=22139&quot;&gt;my recent EVE post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28:00 We move on from EVE and talk about space games more broadly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said in the show, there are a lot of space games on the way. Check it out: &lt;a href=&quot;https://blockaderunnergame.com/&quot;&gt;Blockade Runner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://elite.frontier.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Elite: Dangerous&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.felixvast.com/&quot;&gt;Felix Vast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/&quot;&gt;Kerbal Space Program&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://badlandstudio.com/kinetic-void/&quot;&gt;Kinetic Void&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ltheory.com/&quot;&gt;Limit Theory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mandategame.com/&quot;&gt;The Mandate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRpDn5qPp3s&quot;&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pulsarthegame.com/&quot;&gt;Pulsar: Lost Colony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://elliptic-games.com/&quot;&gt;Rodina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spaceengineersgame.com/&quot;&gt;Space Engineers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://star-made.org/&quot;&gt;Star Made&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://playstarbound.com/&quot;&gt;Starbound&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://robertsspaceindustries.com/about-the-game&quot;&gt;Star Citizen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.starpointgemini.com/&quot;&gt;Starpoint Gemini 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I miss any?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;34:00 Chris is playing Call of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Juarez:_Gunslinger&quot;&gt;Juarez: Gunslinger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only cover this briefly. Not because there’s nothing to talk about, but Rutskarn already went over this a couple of months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;38:30 Chris is also playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bureau:_XCOM_Declassified&quot;&gt;The Bureau: XCOM Declassified&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/comics/stolen-pixels/7435-Stolen-Pixels-186-Well-Lookie-Who-We-Have-Here&quot;&gt;Here’s the rant&lt;/a&gt; (and comic) that I wrote about this game way back in 2010, when it was still in development. Here’s the Polygon Article Chris mentioned: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/8/19/4614410/xcom-the-bureau-development-2006-2013&quot;&gt;The many faces of the bureau: xcom declassified: from 2006 to 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conversation got sidetracked into…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;43:00 Another Mass Effect rant? Really? REALLY?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I blame Chris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;53:00 Mailbag!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talk about Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition and about Steam Early Access program and the difficulties of defining when a game is “done”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Request: When you send us a question (the address is in the splash image at the top of the post) please put “Diecast” in the title so Josh can find them when we finally get around to reading them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <itunes:summary>This episode was recorded AFTER our Spoiler Warning session this week, but it’s being released first. We were a little tired and a couple of hosts short by the time we got to this point.

Hosts: Josh, Chris, and Shamus.

Show notes:

1:00 Shamus is playing Elder Scrolls Online and EVE Online.

We can’t talk about ESO yet. (Embargoed until Feburay 7th.) But we can talk about the battle of B-R5RB. Note that we had this conversation before I did the homework for my recent EVE post.

28:00 We move on from EVE and talk about space games more broadly.

Like I said in the show, there are a lot of space games on the way. Check it out: Blockade Runner, Elite: Dangerous, Felix Vast, Kerbal Space Program, Kinetic Void, Limit Theory, The Mandate, No Man’s Sky, Pulsar: Lost Colony, Rodina, Space Engineers, Star Made, Starbound, Star Citizen, and Starpoint Gemini 2.

Did I miss any?

34:00 Chris is playing Call of Juarez: Gunslinger.

We only cover this briefly. Not because there’s nothing to talk about, but Rutskarn already went over this a couple of months ago.

38:30 Chris is also playing The Bureau: XCOM Declassified

Here’s the rant (and comic) that I wrote about this game way back in 2010, when it was still in development. Here’s the Polygon Article Chris mentioned: The many faces of the bureau: xcom declassified: from 2006 to 2013

This conversation got sidetracked into…

43:00 Another Mass Effect rant? Really? REALLY?

I blame Chris.

53:00 Mailbag!

We talk about Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition and about Steam Early Access program and the difficulties of defining when a game is “done”.

Request: When you send us a question (the address is in the splash image at the top of the post) please put “Diecast” in the title so Josh can find them when we finally get around to reading them.

&lt;p&gt;Show Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-22140&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First three minutes of the show: Mumbles is established as the Podcast Queen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3:00 Shamus is playing SPACE GAMES and Broken Age.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also Shamus gives “marriage advice” on the occasion of his 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; wedding anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11:00 Josh is playing the game Adobe Premiere Doesn’t Friggin’ Work Dammit Hell Shit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh also talks about a Crusader Kings II succession game he’s talking part in. For the uninitiated, CKII is a strategy game where you guide a particular dynasty through the ages. A succession game is where one player runs a generation, and when power passes on in the game, the save file is given to another player and they take over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also we talk about the weather for like ten minutes. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22:30 Chris kicks off a discussion about Nintendo, the Wii U and their troubled sales.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nintendo projected 9 million Wii U’s sold, but when the numbers came in it was more like 2.5 million. Now they’re in a tough spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2014-secret-developers-wii-u-the-inside-story&quot;&gt;Here is the article I mentioned&lt;/a&gt;. In the article we learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wii hardware wasn’t finalized until very late in development, and without a lot of communication with developers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The hardware is incredibly weak, bordering on Xbox 360 level of power.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The people at Nintendo that designed the Wii U do not use or have any understanding of the other consoles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Wii U development tools are horrible, bordering on the barbaric.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nintendo has shameful support for third parties, to the point that their few third-party devs have trouble getting coherent answers to basic technology questions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Also Shamus gives “marriage advice” on the occasion of his 17th wedding anniversary.

Nintendo projected 9 million Wii U’s sold, but when the numbers came in it was more like 2.5 million. Now they’re in a tough spot.

Here is the article I mentioned. In the article we learn:

&lt;p&gt;Show notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-21987&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;01:00 Shamus got over his Skyrim problem and made screensaver.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, the mods I was using are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26228/?&quot;&gt;Realistic Needs &amp;amp; Diseases&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11163/?&quot;&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25404/?&quot;&gt;Random Alternate Start&lt;/a&gt;, along with about 40 others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already talked about the screensaver &lt;a href=&quot;?p=21977&quot; title=&quot;Passage Screensaver&quot;&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13:00 The Elder Scrolls Online&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZUynhkal1I&quot; title=&quot;TUN: The Elder Scrolls VI - Youtubia&quot;&gt;Nerdrage video on Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;51:30 Chris is writing things and talking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbv9rs9bVOE&quot;&gt;Alien Isolation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien:_Isolation&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whaaat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you’re playing as Ripley’s daughter. Who is an adult. Not only does this muck with establish canon, but it drags in a character that was better left where she was: Having lived a perfectly mundane and unremarkable life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A much better idea? Let us play as Newt. You wouldn’t have to screw with any existing lore, and the mechanics are all right there in the movie: Newt survives by hiding in tight spots and using her wits. She can crawl through the duct work and watch the Aliens tear through the colonists. We’ve got a huge installation to work with and lots of blank space on the timeline. It would be a very cat-and-mouse type stealth, where the tension comes from the times when you’re obliged to leave the safety of the vents and venture into the open to accomplish something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying it can’t be a great game, but the whole “Ripley’s daughter” thing smacks of ham-handed fanfiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that: This is the first Alien game in ages that sounds promising. Survival stealth? Oh yeah. I’m on board with that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <itunes:summary>Hosts: Rutskarn, Josh, Chris, and Shamus.

Show notes:

01:00 Shamus got over his Skyrim problem and made screensaver.

For the record, the mods I was using are Realistic Needs &amp; Diseases, Frostfall, and Random Alternate Start, along with about 40 others.

I already talked about the screensaver earlier this week.

13:00 The Elder Scrolls Online

Here is the Nerdrage video on Elder Scrolls.

51:30 Chris is writing things and talking about Alien Isolation.

From Wikipedia:

Whaaat?

So you’re playing as Ripley’s daughter. Who is an adult. Not only does this muck with establish canon, but it drags in a character that was better left where she was: Having lived a perfectly mundane and unremarkable life on Earth.

A much better idea? Let us play as Newt. You wouldn’t have to screw with any existing lore, and the mechanics are all right there in the movie: Newt survives by hiding in tight spots and using her wits. She can crawl through the duct work and watch the Aliens tear through the colonists. We’ve got a huge installation to work with and lots of blank space on the timeline.

I’m not saying it can’t be a great game, but the whole “Ripley’s daughter” thing smacks of ham-handed fanfiction.

Having said that: This is the first Alien game in ages that sounds promising. Survival stealth? Oh yeah. I’m on board with that.

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Hosts: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chocolatehammer.org/&quot;&gt;Rutskarn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelly_bean&quot;&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale&quot;&gt;Shamus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-21962&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0:00 Josh has Jellybeans.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside: Last year I watched &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hulu.com/watch/371272&quot;&gt;Candyman: The David Klein Story&lt;/a&gt;. (That link goes to Hulu where you can watch it for free.) It’s interesting and a little sad. It also made me want to eat candy, so watch out for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:00 Rutskarn is playing the Saints Row 4.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talk about the series, compare the humor to GTA, discuss the the “romance scenes”, and talk about choice and Mass Effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17:30 Chris is playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://continue9876543210.com/&quot;&gt;Continue?9876543421&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28:00 Shamus is playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m7rmb3QrN8&quot;&gt;The Novelist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a game all about balancing creative work with family life. Like I said in the show: I found a lot of meaning in the game, but it depicts a problem we spent years dealing with. I’m curious if it holds the same appeal for someone that hasn’t been through this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;42:00 Josh is playing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldofys.com/ysc/&quot;&gt;Ys Chronicles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;46:00 Rutskarn recaps the &lt;a href=&quot;http://forthechildrenandstuff.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Aunty Paladins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rutskarn spins us a yarn of how the stream went and shares some of the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:02:00 Chris talks about his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/?p=603&quot;&gt;Patreon campaign&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this &lt;em&gt;incredibly encouraging&lt;/em&gt;. I might give this topic a post of its own, but the short version is that by sponsoring a show directly, the money ends up in the hands of the people who make the content we love. Compare this to the old model where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acme buys advertising space on YouTube.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ad runs on a video made by Bob.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carla clicks on the ad. (Probably by accident, if my own surfing habits are any indication.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;YouTube gives a tiny little bit of the advertising money to Bob.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all too often:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li value=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Actually, some jackass copyright troll flags Bob as producing infringing content and siphons off some of his revenue while Bob spends time disputing the claim instead of making more content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acme can’t tell where their ad shows up or who will see it in this madcap YouTube world.  YouTube doesn’t care about the quality of Bob’s show as long as people watch it. Bob doesn’t care about Acme as long as he gets his money. When Carla clicks, it’s not because she likes Bob’s show, but because she’s ostensibly interested in Acme. The parties all have goals that are either completely unrelated or even in conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an awful system, and the only reason we’re using it is because we don’t have anything better. Services like Subbable and Patreon might be a way to route around this madness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Errant Signal? Want to encourage it? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.patreon.com/errantsignal&quot;&gt;You can support it here&lt;/a&gt;. And as Chris is quick to say: &lt;em&gt;The show will continue whether you give or not.&lt;/em&gt; Giving is your way of saying, “Dear internet. Make more stuff like this.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <itunes:summary>Hosts: Rutskarn, Josh, Chris, and Shamus.

Show notes:

0:00 Josh has Jellybeans.

Aside: Last year I watched Candyman: The David Klein Story. (That link goes to Hulu where you can watch it for free.) It’s interesting and a little sad. It also made me want to eat candy, so watch out for that.

2:00 Rutskarn is playing the Saints Row 4.

We talk about the series, compare the humor to GTA, discuss the the “romance scenes”, and talk about choice and Mass Effect.

17:30 Chris is playing Continue?9876543421.

28:00 Shamus is playing The Novelist.

This is a game all about balancing creative work with family life. Like I said in the show: I found a lot of meaning in the game, but it depicts a problem we spent years dealing with. I’m curious if it holds the same appeal for someone that hasn’t been through this.

42:00 Josh is playing the Ys Chronicles.

46:00 Rutskarn recaps the Aunty Paladins.

Rutskarn spins us a yarn of how the stream went and shares some of the highlights.

1:02:00 Chris talks about his Patreon campaign.

I find this incredibly encouraging. I might give this topic a post of its own, but the short version is that by sponsoring a show directly, the money ends up in the hands of the people who make the content we love. Compare this to the old model where:

      <title>Diecast #40: Happy New Years Evesmass-ica.</title>

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Happy new year! Rather than doing a big year-end retrospective, we talked about the here &amp;amp; now like we usually do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I produced this episode. Josh usually does it, but he’s visiting his parents and doesn’t have access to his normal equipment. So any complaints about the audio quality should be directed at me. Note also that I make about two episodes a year, so your complaints won’t do any good because I end up re-learning the whole process from scratch every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosts: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus&quot;&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale&quot;&gt;Shamus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show notes:&lt;span id=&quot;more-21904&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;3:00 Josh is sick, and so he’s taking &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fireballwhisky.com/index.cfm&quot;&gt;Fireball Whiskey&lt;/a&gt; in search of the cure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I don’t know if gargling with alcohol is medically useful for killing throat-based infections, but it FEELS like it helps. The only reason I doubt it is: If all you needed to do to kill throat cultures was gargle alcohol, wouldn’t they have figured it out ages ago? Wouldn’t this just be standard procedure for sore throats?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside: How could you do a proper &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment&quot;&gt;double-blind&lt;/a&gt; study on this? With most tests, you can easily administer a placebo without detection. But the test subject is going to feel that alcohol in their throat and the control subject won’t, and that sensation is going to skew the results. I don’t know. I  think the best solution is for us to make a field trip to the liquor store and begin what I’m calling a “blind drunk trial”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given how good it feels, I can’t believe this treatment doesn’t go all the way back to the middle ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:30 Josh got &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_TIE_Fighter&quot;&gt;Tie Fighter&lt;/a&gt; working on his tablet, using a 360 controller with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dosbox.com/&quot;&gt;Dos Box&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is madness. Awesome madness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:00 Josh is playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://projectzomboid.com/&quot;&gt;Project Zomboid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We throw out the term “offsite SVN” without explaining it.  For the record, SVN is a system for keeping track of source code. An offsite one is a place where you can upload your code so that even if your computer gets hit by an asteroid, you still have a complete record of your code, your documentation, and the history of the project. VERY useful. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitbucket.org/&quot;&gt;BitBucket&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I claimed I was a “one man operation”, which is completely untrue. I have Peter Olson going over my revisions and making sure it all works on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19:00 Chris is playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pinballarcade.com/GetItNow/&quot;&gt;The Pinball Arcade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.game.simpsons4_na&quot;&gt;Simpsons: Tapped Out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27:00 We talk about the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://riseofthetriad.net/web/app.php&quot;&gt;Rise of the Triad&lt;/a&gt;. Here is footage of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqAQLHkRs18&quot;&gt;the original&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;35:00 Shamus is playing Skyrim. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talk about the oddball leveling, the screwy balance, the broken economy, and the way the modding scene is becoming more visible and useful to the community.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We usually do a little warm-up before the show. We talk for a bit and get our brains thinking about games. But about ten minutes into the warm-up we realized we were basically doing the show, so we started recording. No plan. No designated host. No timer. The result is two hours of rambling and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosts: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chocolatehammer.org/&quot;&gt;Rutskarn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Rasputin&quot;&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale&quot;&gt;Shamus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-21815&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18:30 Frozen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re talking about the recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbQm5doF_Uc&quot;&gt;Disney movie&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/escape-to-the-movies/8507-Frozen&quot;&gt;MovieBob review&lt;/a&gt; I mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25:00 Rustkarn is playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_Returns&quot;&gt;Shadowrun Returns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30:00 Rutskarn also finished Skyrim.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This completes his multi-game play-through of the Elder Scrolls series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;40:30 Shamus is playing &lt;a href=&quot;?p=21722&quot;&gt;Batman: Arkham Origins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://playstarbound.com/&quot;&gt;Starbound&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;48:00 We stop the podcast for a minute to watch the trailer for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNVgVl6v6YU&quot;&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/a&gt;, and then come back to share our reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this segment I said that there’s no way this is an indie project by four people. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/12/10/interview-no-mans-sky-and-procedural-generation/&quot;&gt;In this RPS interview&lt;/a&gt; it sounds like the team is actually four people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;57:30 Josh picked up a bunch of Steam sale games, so we talk about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tornbanner.com/chivalry/&quot;&gt;Chivalry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godus&quot;&gt;Godus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.europauniversalis4.com/&quot;&gt;Europa Universalis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1:40:00 Chris is playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.needforspeed.com/rivals&quot;&gt;Need for Speed: Rivals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hanakogames.com/llq.shtml&quot;&gt;Long Live the Queen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <itunes:summary>We usually do a little warm-up before the show. We talk for a bit and get our brains thinking about games. But about ten minutes into the warm-up we realized we were basically doing the show, so we started recording. No plan. No designated host. No timer. The result is two hours of rambling and confusion.

You’re welcome.

Hosts: Rutskarn, Josh, Chris, and Shamus.

Show notes:

18:30 Frozen

We’re talking about the recent Disney movie. Here’s the MovieBob review I mentioned.

25:00 Rustkarn is playing Shadowrun Returns.

30:00 Rutskarn also finished Skyrim.

This completes his multi-game play-through of the Elder Scrolls series.

40:30 Shamus is playing Batman: Arkham Origins and Starbound.

48:00 We stop the podcast for a minute to watch the trailer for No Man’s Sky, and then come back to share our reactions.

During this segment I said that there’s no way this is an indie project by four people. In this RPS interview it sounds like the team is actually four people.

57:30 Josh picked up a bunch of Steam sale games, so we talk about Chivalry and Godus and Europa Universalis.

1:40:00 Chris is playing Need for Speed: Rivals and Long Live the Queen.

&lt;p&gt;Show Notes:&lt;span id=&quot;more-21596&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1:00 We Dump on Oblivion for ten minutes for no reason.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Rutskarn Wants to be an Anthropologist&lt;acronym title=&quot;(When he grows up.)&quot;&gt;!&lt;/acronym&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17:30 Shamus is watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bradyharan.com/&quot;&gt;Brady Haran videos&lt;/a&gt; and playing Kerbal Space Program. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Rutskarn drags us back to Anthropology again. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Cows-Pigs-Wars-Witches-Riddles/dp/0679724680&quot;&gt;Here’s the book he’s banging on about&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30:00 Josh is playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/acepatrolgame&quot;&gt;Sid Meier’s Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh would have us believe that Top Gun was not a documentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also talk about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Gilbert&quot;&gt;Ron Gilbert&lt;/a&gt;‘s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beepgames.com/p/scurvy-scallywags.html&quot;&gt;Scurvy Scallywags&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;You know what we need more of around here? Controversy. Nothing livens things up more than gnawing on the old bones of a horse that was flogged to death in the flamewars of yesteryear. If we’re lucky, we might get through this without having some kind of rage-driven meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-21557&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;00:30 We talk about Battlefield 4 and how the matchmaking / server browser is cutting-edge 1996 technology. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18:00 Chris talks about the single-player aspects of Battlefield 4. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24:00 The Telltale segment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telltalegames.com/thewolfamongus/&quot;&gt;Wolf Among Us&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telltalegames.com/walkingdead/&quot;&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a non-spoiler discussion, mostly talking about how Telltale is moving TWD forward and discussing what we hope / expect / guess will be in Season 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;35:00 Mumbles talks about &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc.go.com/shows/marvels-agents-of-shield&quot;&gt;Agents of SHIELD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href=&quot;http://penny-arcade.com/comic/2013/11/11&quot;&gt;This Penny Arcade strip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris references this gem: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFHlJ2voJHY&quot;&gt;MST3K – Space Mutiny – The many names of David Ryder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;48:30 Shamus is playing vanilla Minecraft 1.7.2. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re curious, the map project I mentioned is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;49:00 Mailbag:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil (or Neal? Or perhaps Kneel? I don’t have the email handy) asks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“How much do you think the bad behavior of and reputation of so-called “gaming culture” has to do with it coinciding with the transparency and anonymity of the internet?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be our favorite question so far. It certainly launched the most discussion, and I’ll bet we could have filled an entire episode on the topic if we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this discussion I mention &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/jimquisition/8371-Cloak-and-Dagger&quot;&gt;this episode of Jimquisition&lt;/a&gt;, talking about how most game journalism is simply relaying information provided by marketing. We also discuss &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman&quot;&gt;Neil Gaiman&lt;/a&gt;‘s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_(comics)&quot;&gt;Angela&lt;/a&gt; character. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/the-big-picture/7075-Marvel-Mess&quot;&gt;The business side of her character&lt;/a&gt; is a lot more interesting than the narrative side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:04:30 Why gender-based discussions suck so bad.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping we can get through this topic with minimal loss of life.&lt;/p&gt;

Show notes:

00:30 We talk about Battlefield 4 and how the matchmaking / server browser is cutting-edge 1996 technology.

18:00 Chris talks about the single-player aspects of Battlefield 4.

24:00 The Telltale segment: Wolf Among Us and The Walking Dead.

This is a non-spoiler discussion, mostly talking about how Telltale is moving TWD forward and discussing what we hope / expect / guess will be in Season 2.

35:00 Mumbles talks about Agents of SHIELD.

Related: This Penny Arcade strip.

Chris references this gem: MST3K – Space Mutiny – The many names of David Ryder

48:30 Shamus is playing vanilla Minecraft 1.7.2.

If you’re curious, the map project I mentioned is this:

49:00 Mailbag:

Neil (or Neal? Or perhaps Kneel? I don’t have the email handy) asks:

This might be our favorite question so far. It certainly launched the most discussion, and I’ll bet we could have filled an entire episode on the topic if we wanted.

During this discussion I mention this episode of Jimquisition, talking about how most game journalism is simply relaying information provided by marketing. We also discuss Neil Gaiman‘s Angela character. The business side of her character is a lot more interesting than the narrative side.

1:04:30 Why gender-based discussions suck so bad.

Hoping we can get through this topic with minimal loss of life.

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Often people tone down their criticism when talking about indie games. I know I do.  It’s easy to dump on a huge multi-million dollar project with hundreds of contributors. But when you’re talking about something made by half a dozen people, it all becomes kind of personal and I’m shy of eviscerating something on that level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes you have to give a game the thrashing it deserves. This week is a reckoning for a handful of misbegotten indies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosts: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chocolatehammer.org/&quot;&gt;Rutskarn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Dead_Ringer&quot;&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nicemovemumbles&quot;&gt;Mumbles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/&quot; title=&quot;Errant Signal&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale&quot;&gt;Shamus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the process of discussing the game and the horror genre in general, we talk about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7th_Guest&quot;&gt;7th Guest&lt;/a&gt; and the recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1559170459/the-7th-guest-3-the-collector&quot;&gt;7th Guest 3 Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20:00 Chris is playing Batman: Arkham Origins and Battlefield 4.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also spend some time talking about good ol’ Team Fortress 2 and how the game has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;35:00 Shamus has been playing indie games. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Void_(video_game)&quot;&gt;The Void&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://spelunkyworld.com/&quot;&gt;Spelunky&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eldritchgame.com/&quot;&gt;Eldrich&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these three games: He praises one, complains about a second, and hates on the third. But not in that order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;49:00 Mumbles has been playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_Origins&quot;&gt;Batman: Arkham Origins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an in-depth discussion about the new Batman game from Mumbles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1:00:00 Rutkarn has played &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telltalegames.com/thewolfamongus/&quot;&gt;The Wolf Among Us&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/246580/&quot;&gt;Typing of the Dead: Overkill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Of these three games: He praises one, complains about a second, and hates on the third. But not in that order.

49:00 Mumbles has been playing Batman: Arkham Origins.

Here is an in-depth discussion about the new Batman game from Mumbles.

1:00:00 Rutkarn has played The Wolf Among Us and Typing of the Dead: Overkill.

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;While we didn’t record it with Halloween in mind, I guess this is our Halloween episode. This year we decided to dress up as guys with audio that cuts out worse than usual for no reason. What’s your costume this year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosts: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chocolatehammer.org/&quot;&gt;Rutskarn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Incinerator&quot;&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/&quot; title=&quot;Errant Signal&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale&quot;&gt;Shamus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

When the siren went off I didn’t know where to go, but then that door opened up and the narrator did the thing with the wastebasket.” It’s gibberish to someone who hasn’t played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point being, this section is either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Terrible, terrible spoilers.&lt;br /&gt; 2) Annoying impenetrable nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14:00 Batman: Arkham Origins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This segment is also free of Stanley Parable spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;39:00 We will not be discussing the Stanley Parable in this segment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I lied again.  The previous segment is packed with Stanley Parable spoilers. It’s brimming with them.  In fact, I don’t think you could get a greater density of spoilers than what we had in the last segment. This segment is safe, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead we talk about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jRcYY3c344&quot;&gt;Gas Guzzlers Extreme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s taking playing through all the games, in order, with the same character. (Inasmuch as that’s even possible to have the “same” character in such a mechanically diverse series.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talk about BioWare and LGBT characters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <itunes:summary>While we didn’t record it with Halloween in mind, I guess this is our Halloween episode. This year we decided to dress up as guys with audio that cuts out worse than usual for no reason. What’s your costume this year?

Hosts: Rutskarn, Josh, Chris, and Shamus.

Show notes:

1:00 The public health hazards of fun-size candy bars.

7:15 THE STANLEY PARABLE.

While the stuff we discuss are spoilers in the technical sense, I don’t know if we’re actually likely to ruin any surprises. I’m not even sure the conversation will make sense. We might say nonsense things like, “Did you get the toaster ending? When the siren went off I didn’t know where to go, but then that door opened up and the narrator did the thing with the wastebasket.” It’s gibberish to someone who hasn’t played.

The point being, this section is either:

1) Terrible, terrible spoilers. 2) Annoying impenetrable nonsense.

14:00 Batman: Arkham Origins

We also briefly digress into talking about the new Saint’s Row DLC.

27:00 Okay, I lied. We didn’t actually spoil the Stanley Parable in that earlier segment.

This segment is also free of Stanley Parable spoilers.

39:00 We will not be discussing the Stanley Parable in this segment.

Actually, I lied again.  The previous segment is packed with Stanley Parable spoilers. It’s brimming with them.  In fact, I don’t think you could get a greater density of spoilers than what we had in the last segment. This segment is safe, though.

Instead we talk about Gas Guzzlers Extreme.

44:00 Rutskarn’s Great Voyage Through all the Elder Scrolls Titles

He’s taking playing through all the games, in order, with the same character. (Inasmuch as that’s even possible to have the “same” character in such a mechanically diverse series.)

1:11:11 MAILBAG!

We talk about BioWare and LGBT characters.

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We open today’s show with a secret topic that I will not reveal.  The only hint I’ll give you is that it’s about a certain perpetually broken and tragically mismanaged game that has appeared on the show many times in the past, was published by EA, and features the simulation of a city based on a game concept by Will Wright. See if you can unravel &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; riddle, Batman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can’t figure it out in the space of five minutes, the answer is: &lt;strike&gt;Shame on you.&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosts: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chocolatehammer.org/&quot;&gt;Rutskarn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Incinerator&quot;&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/&quot; title=&quot;Errant Signal&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale&quot;&gt;Shamus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-21289&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8:00 Actual start of show&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:30 Shamus talks about Good Robot and also about &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/236450/&quot;&gt;Pac-Man Super Mega Championship Classic Ultimate Remix DX Turbo III HD Gold Edition Plus&lt;/a&gt; or whatever the damn thing is called.&lt;/strong&gt; Also a bit of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reusgame.com/&quot;&gt;Reus&lt;/a&gt;, which is very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17:00 Josh is messing with Crusader Kings II mods.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26:00 Chris has been in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/?p=564&quot;&gt;vacation land&lt;/a&gt;. We also talk about the Escapist Expo.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;41:30 Rutskarn talks Elder Scrolls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see only the best parts of Morrowind, then you want to read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chocolatehammer.org/?p=834&quot;&gt;Rutskarn’s play-through&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <itunes:summary>We open today’s show with a secret topic that I will not reveal.  The only hint I’ll give you is that it’s about a certain perpetually broken and tragically mismanaged game that has appeared on the show many times in the past, was published by EA, and features the simulation of a city based on a game concept by Will Wright. See if you can unravel that riddle, Batman.

If you can’t figure it out in the space of five minutes, the answer is: Shame on you.

Hosts: Rutskarn, Josh, Chris, and Shamus.

Show notes:

8:00 Actual start of show

26:00 Chris has been in vacation land. We also talk about the Escapist Expo.

41:30 Rutskarn talks Elder Scrolls

If you want to see only the best parts of Morrowind, then you want to read Rutskarn’s play-through.

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I was worried about recording an episode on Saturday to release on Thursday. A lot can happen in the course of five days, and some bit of news might come along to make our discussion irrelevant.  Then I remembered that we’re talking about Valve, and Valve only makes non-hat announcements on odd-numbered years.  So maybe in 2017 we can have &lt;em&gt;Diecast #230: Valve has released a photograph showing the first Steam Machines will be orange. Still no release date. Still no Half-Life 3&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosts: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chocolatehammer.org/&quot;&gt;Rutskarn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian&quot;&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalmumbles.com/&quot; title=&quot;Digital Mumbles&quot;&gt;Mumbles&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale&quot;&gt;Shamus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-21265&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:00 Steam Machines you guys. STEEM MASHIENZ!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19:00 Haptics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;35:00 Rutskarn talks about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.destructoid.com/permanent-death-exploring-harsh-consequence-in-far-cry-2-156839.phtml&quot;&gt;a permadeath run of Far Cry 2&lt;/a&gt; and how it can fundamentally alter your perception of the game.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;46:30 Mumbles is playing GTA V and looking for a good RPG.  No, not the one you’re thinking of. She wants a GOOD one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:01:00 Shamus talks a bit about Good Robot and the music people have offered.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously composers: You folks are doing a fine job.  But the number and quality of the submissions has kind of caught me off guard. I’ve got submissions via email, comments, and Twitter. I’m going to try and organize this stuff and see what I’ve got, what I need, and who made it. We’ll talk more about this in a future entry and I’m going to want to trade emails with anyone offering tracks for the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on this later.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Feel sorry for Chris.  We got to do the podcast this week, while he was forced away from his job and dragged to Disney World. He’s probably miserable right now, sitting in the gorgeous weather and scenery, drinking a beer, and wishing he was with his internet-friends. He can’t even produce an Errant Signal from there. Poor guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosts: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chocolatehammer.org/&quot;&gt;Rutskarn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Spy&quot;&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalmumbles.com/&quot; title=&quot;Digital Mumbles&quot;&gt;Mumbles&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale&quot;&gt;Shamus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show notes: &lt;span id=&quot;more-21208&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:00 Shamus is annoyed with how the game Brothers ended.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPOILERS!&lt;/strong&gt; We go on to compare other well-known downer endings and talk about what makes an ending work and what doesn’t. We talk about The Walking Dead, Mass Effect 3, and Brothers. It was impossible to have this conversation without a few spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers:_A_Tale_of_Two_Sons&quot;&gt;Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, and I recommend spoiling the ending first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:45 Mumbles is Birthday-ing this week. She’s also playing GTA V.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22:00 Here we ramble our way into talking Borderlands 2. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26:30 Josh talks a little bit about his experience playing Good Robot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;31:30 Talking about Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;34:00 Rutskarn is playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ftlgame.com/&quot;&gt;FTL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gunpointgame.com/&quot;&gt;Gunpoint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;53:00 Mailbag!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In talking about Dreamfall, I referenced &lt;a href=&quot;?p=682&quot;&gt;my old rant on the end of the game&lt;/a&gt;. Check it out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correct on all counts. I’m 42, my daughter is about to turn 16, and I barely remember the game aside from being angry at the end. Also relevant is &lt;a href=&quot;?p=1006&quot;&gt;this ancient post on why I dislike episodic games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I still recommend Brothers, and I recommend spoiling the ending first.

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It’s another rambling chit-chat that’s long on anecdotes and short on news.

&lt;p&gt;We also digress into game piracy vs. abandonware. (And also Sim City. Obviously.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Here is an hour and a half of five people talking about videogames. We got together and realized that one of the big problems in the world is that people don’t spend enough time talking about videogames.

&lt;p&gt;Josh is playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QP5X6fcukM&quot;&gt;Papers, Please&lt;/a&gt;. And as a reminder, later today he’ll be playing &lt;em&gt;Rome II, Complete and Absolute War&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mumbles left Guild Wars 2 for the Old Republic. She’s also playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themightyquest.com/en&quot;&gt;Quest for Epic Loot&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s in closed beta and she can’t talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris is playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LYfCs5bfyI&quot;&gt;Saint’s Row IV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://infinity.disney.com/?cmp=KNC|INFINITY|Pre-Order|GGL|G_Media-Ad||Media-Ads-Toy-Box-Trailer||Disney-Infinity-Exact|WDPR-Global-Media|||&quot;&gt;Disney Infinity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shamus has been playing &lt;em&gt;Papers, Please&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Saints Row IV&lt;/em&gt;. During this segment Chris mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidsgallant.com/igtced.html&quot;&gt;I get this call Every Day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rutskarn is playing Gone Home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;00:37:00 A talk about game duration vs. the pricetag of the game.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shamus tells a long rambling story about how game prices relate to the airplane ride he took as a kid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;41:00 Rustkarn talks about Crusader Kings II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;45:00 Sim City Online has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.computerandvideogames.com/427268/launch-issues-blight-simcity-release-on-mac/&quot;&gt;troubled launch on Macs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really is amazing how this game can continue to find new ways to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;51:00 Mumbles talks about Dragon Age 3&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:00:00 Somewhere around this point we segue into talking about focus testing and the way it (should) shape games.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We compare the changes made to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYowhad_1mw&quot;&gt;Overstrike&lt;/a&gt; to the changes made in Portal 2.&lt;/p&gt;

      <itunes:summary>Here is an hour and a half of five people talking about videogames. We got together and realized that one of the big problems in the world is that people don’t spend enough time talking about videogames. So we went beyond the call of duty and gave you an extra half an hour.

You’re welcome.

Show notes:  02:00 What’s the Happy-haps?

Josh is playing Papers, Please. And as a reminder, later today he’ll be playing Rome II, Complete and Absolute War.

Shamus has been playing Papers, Please and Saints Row IV. During this segment Chris mentioned I get this call Every Day.

Rutskarn is playing Gone Home.

Shamus tells a long rambling story about how game prices relate to the airplane ride he took as a kid.

&lt;p&gt;Shamus is writing code, &lt;a href=&quot;?p=20732&quot;&gt;writing about writing code&lt;/a&gt;, and in this show he’s talking about writing about writing code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27:30 Chris is playing a lot of stuff. To wit:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We don’t talk about Gone Home in this episode, but we wanted to. We do spend the first segment of the show talking about how we reacted to the game. I don’t know if it’ll get its own one-off special, or if we’ll just give it a couple of weeks so people can play through it. But I will say the response from the cast is universally positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosts: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chocolatehammer.org/&quot;&gt;Rutskarn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker&quot;&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalmumbles.com/&quot;&gt;Mumbles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale&quot;&gt;Shamus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;01:00 What is all the peoples doing this week?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh is playing Gone Home. He’s also playing Warthunder and suggests that you &lt;a href=&quot;http://warthunder.com/en/registration?r=userinvite_1186666&quot;&gt;sign up using this link&lt;/a&gt; in order to most optimally benefit him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris is playing Gone Home and Spelunky. He also made &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNDk7D0yG0&quot;&gt;this video about Gone Home&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mumbles is playing Gone Home and Guild Wars 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shamus is playing Gone Home, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/games/avww-features&quot;&gt;Valley Without Wind&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://kairo.lockeddoorpuzzle.com/&quot;&gt;Kairo&lt;/a&gt;. (I called it “Kairos” throughout this segment. In my defense, a friend of mine owned a coffee shop called Kairos and saying “Kairo” is like trying to say “Borderland”. It’s hard to make my mouth stop before the s!) But mostly coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rutskarn is playing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.humblebundle.com/&quot;&gt;Humble Origin Bundle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27:00 (ish) The Sims, in general. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a planned topic, but we spent some time talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;38:00 Sim City News&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Gimmie five bucks to not stab you” video is here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyaUUzgHfeM&quot;&gt;Doctor Who – Hey Ash Whatcha Playin’?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We spend a lot of time talking about what we’re playing. Conceptually the Diecast has three segments: The personal warm-up talk about what we’re playing, the supposedly informed discussion of current gaming news, and the mailbag. Often a third of the show is spent on the warmup, and the mailbag often gets pushed out. How do you guys feel about that? Would you rather more news discussion? Or more mailbag?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that we’re promising to change anything. I’m just askin’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosts: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll&quot;&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalmumbles.com/&quot;&gt;Mumbles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale&quot;&gt;Shamus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-20625&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;00:30 What’s everyone playing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh is playing Metro: Last Light and Civilization V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mumbles went to NATURE and bought Magic Cards. She also played The Secret World. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwbWxaIA4bM&amp;amp;noredirect=1&quot;&gt;Here is the Banjo-Kazooie promo&lt;/a&gt; we talked about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris is playing Return to Nai Pali, the expansion for the original Unreal. Also &lt;a href=&quot;http://spelunkyworld.com/&quot;&gt;Spelunky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://guacamelee.com/&quot;&gt;Guacamelee&lt;/a&gt; but not &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVmq2dNzOG4&quot;&gt;Dragon’s Crown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shamus is playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8TnP-mgDoI&quot;&gt;Doom&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; BFG edition&lt;/a&gt; and doing a lot of programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20:20 Games Journalism is tough gig with low pay and poor job security.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2013/08/07/daily-reaction-how-to-get-into-games-journalism-and-why-you-probably-shouldnt/&quot;&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;51:00 We talk about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feministfrequency.com/tag/tropes-vs-women-in-video-games/&quot;&gt;Tropes vs. Women&lt;/a&gt; series and how it’s improving.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t say anything terribly controversial here, so I hope people can keep calm. And if anyone does feel the need to object, I hope you can do it calmly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Special episode this week.  There’s no news we care to talk about, so we’re answering mailbag questions. Note that I’ve paraphrased the questions in the show notes because I don’t want to transcribe the originals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosts: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt&quot;&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chocolatehammer.org/&quot;&gt;Rutskarn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/&quot; title=&quot;DUH&quot;&gt;Shamus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-20588&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:00 What’s everyone playing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris is playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.roguelegacy.com/&quot;&gt;Rogue Legacy&lt;/a&gt;, Animal Crossing, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.civilization5.com/bravenewworld/&quot;&gt;Civilization V: Brave New World&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rutskarn is writing for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pyrodactyl/unrest-an-unconventional-rpg-set-in-ancient-india&quot;&gt;Unrest&lt;/a&gt; and playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEwNkSQAWtE&quot;&gt;Sleeping Dogs&lt;/a&gt;. He’s also looking for a job making words for a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shamus has been playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJVlfFj9uI&quot;&gt;Titan Attacks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKkIYQc55ZE&quot;&gt;Ultratron&lt;/a&gt; from indie developer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppygames.net/&quot;&gt;Puppygames&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Josh is playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DUCA8wK9Ls&quot;&gt;Metro: Last Light&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20:00 What is you opinion of game design colleges?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;38:00 Why are games so obsessed with using “ruins” as gameplay space?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There was a sub-question directed at me, which we forgot about. So I’ll answer it here in the show notes. The question was, “Why do you like Spiderman?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fell in love with Spiderman because he was the first superhero that felt real or relatable to me. Batman was a millionaire playboy. Superman was a handsome invincible saint from another planet. Wonder Woman was a warrior princess of the Amazons. Thor was a Norse God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Spiderman was a “regular” guy and when he took off the mask he had regular guy problems. He wasn’t rich, or famous, or popular. He had to buy his groceries and take out the garbage just like everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;47:00 What do you think about “benign deaths” in videogames like BioShock, Prey, RAGE, and Borderlands?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <itunes:summary>Special episode this week.  There’s no news we care to talk about, so we’re answering mailbag questions. Note that I’ve paraphrased the questions in the show notes because I don’t want to transcribe the originals.

Hosts: Chris, Josh, Rutskarn and Shamus.

Show notes:

1:00 What’s everyone playing?

Chris is playing Rogue Legacy, Animal Crossing, and Civilization V: Brave New World.

Rutskarn is writing for Unrest and playing Sleeping Dogs. He’s also looking for a job making words for a living.

Shamus has been playing Titan Attacks and Ultratron from indie developer Puppygames. Also programming.

Josh is playing Metro: Last Light.

20:00 What is you opinion of game design colleges?

38:00 Why are games so obsessed with using “ruins” as gameplay space?

There was a sub-question directed at me, which we forgot about. So I’ll answer it here in the show notes. The question was, “Why do you like Spiderman?”

I fell in love with Spiderman because he was the first superhero that felt real or relatable to me. Batman was a millionaire playboy. Superman was a handsome invincible saint from another planet. Wonder Woman was a warrior princess of the Amazons. Thor was a Norse God.

But Spiderman was a “regular” guy and when he took off the mask he had regular guy problems. He wasn’t rich, or famous, or popular. He had to buy his groceries and take out the garbage just like everyone else.

47:00 What do you think about “benign deaths” in videogames like BioShock, Prey, RAGE, and Borderlands?

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Some behind-the-scenes info: We generally forward news stories to each other all week. When Sunday rolls around, we take the headlines for the week, sort them out, and figure out which ones we want to talk about and which ones we don’t. Then we record the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we had nothing. Not one news story. I don’t know if we weren’t following the news or we didn’t care, but we had no stories and nothing to say. We just got together for our once-a-week blather session and Josh began recording halfway through. That means this podcast is even less structured than last week. Just so you know what you’re getting into. In any case, the choice was between this and nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve got a good slate of stories now, so the Diecast should return to normal next week. In the meantime, you’ve been warned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosts: Shamus, Josh, Rutskarn, Mumbles, Chris&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;00:30&lt;/strong&gt; We join the podcast in mid-conversation, talking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1022603/&quot;&gt;500 Days of Summer&lt;/a&gt; and Scott Pilgrim. For reference, &lt;a href=&quot;?p=8999&quot; title=&quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. MY FACE&quot;&gt;here is what I had to say about Scott Pilgrim when it came out&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://moviebob.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;MovieBob&lt;/a&gt; video &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chocolatehammer.org/&quot; title=&quot;Chocolate Hammer&quot;&gt;Rutskarn&lt;/a&gt; mentioned is here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/the-big-picture/7373-Dumping-Irony&quot; title=&quot;The Big Picture: Dumping Irony&quot;&gt;The Big Picture: Dumping Irony&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;09:30&lt;/strong&gt; We troll &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalmumbles.com/&quot;&gt;Mumbles&lt;/a&gt; by not talking about Batman. Instead we talk about Green Lantern, The Aristocrats, and Tacos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15:00&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scribblenauts.com/scribblenauts/unmasked&quot;&gt;Scribblenauts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24:00&lt;/strong&gt; Josh is playing Skyrim. Mumbles video on Skyrim is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84WvpwyEJw8&quot; title=&quot;The Mumbles Problem: Skyrim&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Then we segue into talking about Fallout: New Vegas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;52:30&lt;/strong&gt; MAILBAG! We discuss sharing the hobby, the Kinect, and visual fidelity and game budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I want to apologize to Neil (or Neal) who sent in the long question. While short questions are always better than long in this format, that’s no reason for me to be a jerk about it. Bad form. In my defense, we’d been at this for a couple of hours by this point and I was getting a bit frazzled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got a question for the cast, send it to diecast@shamusyoung.com. Also: Short questions make for better launching points for conversation. Long questions are better left in the comments. (I used to have a special page where people could leave long questions for me to answer. Looks like it got culled last time I tinkered with the site. I’ll look into bringing that back.)&lt;/p&gt;

If you’ve got a question for the cast, send it to diecast@shamusyoung.com. Also: Short questions make for better launching points for conversation. Long questions are better left in the comments. (I used to have a special page where people could leave long questions for me to answer. Looks like it got culled last time I tinkered with the site. I’ll look into bringing that back.)

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Josh couldn’t make it this week. My USB headset broke and my backup evidently has a white noise generator built into it. I did the editing. We forgot to do the mailbag segment. So basically, this episode features the usual level of polish and professionalism you’ve come to expect from us. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also! We we be doing a hangout on Thursday, April 25 at 7pm Eastern Time. (Which works out to midnight on Friday morning, GMT.) I’ll post links and give a heads-up when the show is ready to go live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-19506&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;00:30&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;What’s Everyone Playing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shamus is playing Thief 2 and Thief 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris is playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://jayisgames.com/games/surgeon-simulator-2013/&quot;&gt;Surgeon Simulator 2013&lt;/a&gt;. Which he says is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html&quot;&gt;QWOP&lt;/a&gt; meets &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_Center_(series)&quot;&gt;Trauma Center&lt;/a&gt;. Also he’s playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.starseedpilgrim.com/&quot;&gt;Starseed Pilgrim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rutskarn has played &lt;a href=&quot;http://blendogames.com/thirtyflightsofloving/&quot;&gt;30 Flights of Loving&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we spend several minutes talking about Minecraft mods because I wasn’t sure if people wanted to talk about Minecraft mods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23:00&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;It’s the triumphant return of “Bad SimCity News of the week”!&lt;/em&gt; You can get &lt;a href=&quot;http://penny-arcade.com/report/article/simcity-as-advertising-platform-how-ea-rewards-you-for-buying-real-world-pr&quot;&gt;free SimCity DLC&lt;/a&gt; by buying specially-marked boxes of toothpaste or whatever. At least it’s not &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjXSI6O9lUo&quot;&gt;Doritos and Mountain Dew&lt;/a&gt; this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;33:20&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.warcry.com/news/view/123260-Salem-Dev-Says-MMOs-Without-Permanent-Death-Arent-Games&quot;&gt;The developer of the MMO Salem creates a definition of the word “game”&lt;/a&gt;. Shocking turn: He crafts a definition specifically to favor things he likes and exclude things he doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the discussion, I brought up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realmofthemadgod.com/&quot;&gt;Realm of the Mad God&lt;/a&gt;, which was the basis for the recent Spoiler Warning joke title &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=19479&quot;&gt;Realm of the Bad Dog&lt;/a&gt;, which nobody noticed. Alas. Also we discussed (and made fun of) Peter Molyneux’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_%E2%80%93_What&#x27;s_Inside_the_Cube%3F&quot;&gt;Curiosity – What’s Inside the Cube?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;45:30&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/123266-Crytek-Boss-Says-Visuals-Are-60-of-the-Game#uT20aeqS8lrc1Dwf.99&quot;&gt;Cevat Yerli, the CEO of Crytek, says that graphics are “60% of the game”.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Also! We we be doing a hangout on Thursday, April 25 at 7pm Eastern Time. (Which works out to midnight on Friday morning, GMT.) I’ll post links and give a heads-up when the show is ready to go live.

Show notes:

00:30 What’s Everyone Playing?

Shamus is playing Thief 2 and Thief 3.

Chris is playing Surgeon Simulator 2013. Which he says is QWOP meets Trauma Center. Also he’s playing Starseed Pilgrim.

Rutskarn has played 30 Flights of Loving

And then we spend several minutes talking about Minecraft mods because I wasn’t sure if people wanted to talk about Minecraft mods.

23:00 It’s the triumphant return of “Bad SimCity News of the week”! You can get free SimCity DLC by buying specially-marked boxes of toothpaste or whatever. At least it’s not Doritos and Mountain Dew this time.

33:20 The developer of the MMO Salem creates a definition of the word “game”. Shocking turn: He crafts a definition specifically to favor things he likes and exclude things he doesn’t.

During the discussion, I brought up Realm of the Mad God, which was the basis for the recent Spoiler Warning joke title Realm of the Bad Dog, which nobody noticed. Alas. Also we discussed (and made fun of) Peter Molyneux’s Curiosity – What’s Inside the Cube?

45:30 Cevat Yerli, the CEO of Crytek, says that graphics are “60% of the game”.

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;You know, we had a long list of topics in the queue for this week. We really don’t want this to be an EA bashing podcast. But dangit, EA is just so busy making noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show notes: &lt;span id=&quot;more-19452&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:00&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;What’s everyone playing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rutskarn is playing Galactic Civilizations 2. The first entry of his Let’s Play is here:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chocolatehammer.org/?p=4670&quot; title=&quot; Galactic Civilizations 2: God Save the Space Queen &quot;&gt;Galactic Civilizations 2: God Save the Space Queen&lt;/a&gt;.  He’s also playing some &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_%26_Blade&quot; title=&quot;It&#x27;s Mount &amp;amp; Blade, actually.&quot;&gt;Mountain Blade&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For the archive archaeologists out there, the posts Shamus wrote about this game in 2006 can be found &lt;a href=&quot;?tag=gal-civ&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris is playing Torchlight 2, Super Hexagon, Dishonored DLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15:50&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bad SimCity news this week:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing to report. However, they are working hard to give us something to talk about &lt;a href=&quot;http://penny-arcade.com/report/article/simcity-as-advertising-platform-how-ea-rewards-you-for-buying-real-world-pr&quot;&gt;next week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;33:30 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/123200-EA-Gave-BioWare-Complete-Creative-Control&quot;&gt;EA Gave BioWare “Complete Creative Control”.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;42:50&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;An unplanned tangent on Valve’s approach to Half-Life and the fact that it’s obvious they have no plan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;53:00&lt;/strong&gt; Heads up: Vary mild spoilers for Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows. Additional spoiler warning: The movie could have been a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;57:00&lt;/strong&gt; Mail time. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27sSiqFwnU&quot;&gt;We just got a letter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;On the upside, the podcast is proving to be really popular. On the downside, we seem to be slipping on our production of Spoiler Warning videos. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josh is recovering from surgery where &lt;span class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;nope it’s too gross for me to type you’ll have to listen and hear for yourself&lt;/span&gt;. The “shattering ribcage” joke was a reference to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2XkTIYhQC8&quot;&gt;Surgery Simulator 2013&lt;/a&gt;, which is probably the greatest misappropriation of the word “simulator” in the history of games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shamus was playing BioShock Infinite and BioShock Infinite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12:00&lt;/strong&gt; Horrible SimCity news this week: &lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/a/gW7F9&quot;&gt;Here is the max happiness, max density city with no public services, no jobs, no goods, no resources, no government, no electricity, no hospitals, no crime, no homelessness, and no police&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28:00&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Retro City Rampage&lt;/em&gt;. Chris was talking about the WiiWare Game. I was talking about ROM City Rampage, which is a theoretical port of the game to &lt;del datetime=&quot;2013-04-03T03:26:00+00:00&quot;&gt;N64&lt;/del&gt; &lt;strong&gt;NES&lt;/strong&gt; hardware. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hvx4xXhZMrU&quot;&gt;Here is the video where he describes doing the port&lt;/a&gt;. It’s amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

Then they got an infusion of cash to get the servers back on. And now… now they’re doing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/reloadedprod/all-points-bulletin-apb-vendetta&quot;&gt;a Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;. For a sequel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion morphs into a conversation about Kickstarter in general. Then it’s a conversation about business start-ups. Note that when I said, “Nobody wants to live in a small town” what I really mean is, “EXTROVERTS don’t want to live in a small town.” I strongly suspect the habit of gathering in massive expensive super-cities is a side-effect of 75% of us being extroverts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <itunes:summary>On the upside, the podcast is proving to be really popular. On the downside, we seem to be slipping on our production of Spoiler Warning videos. Oops.

Show notes:

00:30 What’s everyone playing?

Rutskarn is playing BioShock Infinite.

Jarenth is playing BioShock Infinite and Anodyne.

Chris is playing BioShock Infinite.

Josh is recovering from surgery where nope it’s too gross for me to type you’ll have to listen and hear for yourself. The “shattering ribcage” joke was a reference to Surgery Simulator 2013, which is probably the greatest misappropriation of the word “simulator” in the history of games.

Shamus was playing BioShock Infinite and BioShock Infinite.

12:00 Horrible SimCity news this week: Here is the max happiness, max density city with no public services, no jobs, no goods, no resources, no government, no electricity, no hospitals, no crime, no homelessness, and no police. Here is the Something is Wrong With The Offices post that Josh referenced. Here is the video of the broken roads in SimCity. But don’t get worked up, because American McGee thinks everyone needs to calm down.

21:00 Our giant unplanned tangent on piracy.

28:00 Retro City Rampage. Chris was talking about the WiiWare Game. I was talking about ROM City Rampage, which is a theoretical port of the game to N64 NES hardware. Here is the video where he describes doing the port. It’s amazing.

31:00 Remember APB? $100 million to make a crappy, laggy, mechanically boring PvP GTA MMO that closed its doors in 90 days. Then they got an infusion of cash to get the servers back on. And now… now they’re doing a Kickstarter. For a sequel.

The discussion morphs into a conversation about Kickstarter in general. Then it’s a conversation about business start-ups. Note that when I said, “Nobody wants to live in a small town” what I really mean is, “EXTROVERTS don’t want to live in a small town.” I strongly suspect the habit of gathering in massive expensive super-cities is a side-effect of 75% of us being extroverts.

54:00 Activision’s Tech Demo.  Here is the duck demo from a few years back.

Given the transient nature of news and the fact that we’re already discussing things that have aged a few days, I figure the less time between recording and posting the better.

&lt;p&gt;Rutskarn is playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih2BoI0BH_Q&quot;&gt;Jet Set Radio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris has been making &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqm3_v9aZQY&quot;&gt;Errant Signal: Tomb Raider&lt;/a&gt; and playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VfSMvg5wEg&quot;&gt;Dead Space 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh is playing &lt;a href=&quot;?p=15885&quot;&gt;Shogun: Total War&lt;/a&gt;. He’s even dropping hints that there might be another entry in his long-dormant but still-popular series. It’s even possible that such a thing might appear tomorrow. He’s also playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTKXV-qB8j0&quot;&gt;Natural Selection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

These two facts look very bad when juxtaposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news: Since the time of this recording BioShock Infinite has been released and it’s looking like it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/reviews/10250-BioShock-Infinite-Review-A-Head-in-the-Clouds&quot;&gt;really&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pcgamer.com/review/bioshock-infinite-review/&quot;&gt;genuinely&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2013/mar/26/bioshock-infinite-video-game-review&quot;&gt;good&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamespot.com/bioshock-infinite/reviews/bioshock-infinite-review-6405506/&quot;&gt;game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Shamus is playing Tomb Raider, Dustforce, and The Bridge.

Rutskarn is playing Jet Set Radio

Chris has been making Errant Signal: Tomb Raider and playing Dead Space 3.

IGN got permission to publish their review 4 days before everyone else, and it was a fluffy, puffy, sophomoric gush piece with no analysis and little context. These two facts look very bad when juxtaposed.

Good news: Since the time of this recording BioShock Infinite has been released and it’s looking like it really is a genuinely good game.

&lt;p&gt;Josh is watching movies. When I said “Liam Neesons” it was a reference to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comedycentral.com/video-clips/xwnjlx/key-and-peele-liam-neesons&quot; title=&quot;Key &amp;amp; Peele: Liam Neesons&quot;&gt;this Key &amp;amp; Peele sketch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Rutskarn has once again run aground on Knights of the Old Republic II. He’s also playing Fallout: New Vegas with ALL THE MODS.

26:30 SIM CITY IS STILL A STORY WHEN WILL THE NIGHTMARE END?

Here is a partial list of stupid, broken problems in SimCity from Rock, Paper, Shotgun. And another at The Escapist.

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We should probably title these things or something. I mean, if we’re going to keep making episodes then at some point we’ll be like, “Wait. Which one did we discuss playing through Half-Life 2: Episode 3? Was that Diecast #230? No, 230 was when we discussed Sony’s inexplicable decision to design the Playstation 5 with a cotton-candy pink case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, I have no idea how to title long multi-topic discussions in a memorable way. Screw it. We’ll just kick this problem on down the road and let future-us deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;00:15&lt;/strong&gt; Intro. What’s everyone doing?  Shamus is playing Max Payne 3. (I suppose I might as well link to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU0dgjon10U&quot; title=&quot;A Day in the Life of Max Payne&quot;&gt;that one Max Payne video&lt;/a&gt; before someone beats me to it.) Rutskarn is playing KOTOR2. Chris is playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digipen.edu/?id=1170&amp;amp;proj=25930&quot;&gt;Perspective&lt;/a&gt;. Josh is playing…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17:00&lt;/strong&gt; Tomb Raider. The new one. Like, the reboot. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCKHlO9C7Lc&quot;&gt;This one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;40:00&lt;/strong&gt; SimCity. Man, does this story have legs or what? We recorded this on Sunday night, and here on Thursday the follies continue. Sadly, this means a lot of the stuff we discussed or speculated about has now been resolved or rendered moot, only to be replaced by new failures. The latest? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/03/12/simcity-server-not-necessary/&quot; title=&quot;Maxis Insider Tells RPS: SimCity Servers Not Necessary&quot;&gt;Maxis Insider Tells RPS: SimCity Servers Not Necessary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminds me so much of the ages-old &lt;a href=&quot;?p=1290&quot; title=&quot;Bioshock: Miss Misinformation&quot;&gt;BioShock controversy&lt;/a&gt;: A polite spokeswoman is way out of her technical depth and saying things that the tech-savvy users prove to be untrue, thus making inflaming the people they were trying to pacify. Those who do not learn from history, etc. (They are also repeating the mistakes of the Diablo III launch and the Assassin’s Creed 2 launch. So, nice going EA. You are the very last idiot to make this particular blunder.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:03:30&lt;/strong&gt; The Blip.tv story. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/?p=467&quot; title=&quot;Errant Signal&quot;&gt;Here is what Chris posted about it&lt;/a&gt;. And here is the original post where I hurled bricks at the company after too many trips through the same advertisement: &lt;a href=&quot;?p=12158&quot; title=&quot;Blip.TV Sucks&quot;&gt;Blip.tv Sucks&lt;/a&gt;. Stay classy, Shamus.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;With Shamus out for the week, I host and Jarenth guest stars on this exciting installment of the Diecast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now for the show notes, complete with the oft-requested timestamps!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;00:15 – We talk about what we’ve been doing for the past week. Shamus is a zombie, Chris is a Tomb Raider, Rutskarn is Homestuck, Jarenth’s lost in Echo Bazaar, and I’ve been set on the Path of Exile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15:55 – Everything and more about the Playstation 4 announcement, and in particular, the implication that “more polygons = stronger emotional connection.” And if you don’t want to watch the whole thing, VideoGamerTV made a helpful &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJDn0jRnUQ&quot;&gt;abridged version of the conference&lt;/a&gt; that has basically everything that’s important in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;33:00 – We discuss the closure of Civilization World and what it can tell us about the state of Social Games, and how it compares to a similar collapse of the MMO space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;48:00 – Crytek jumps on the free-to-play bandwagon and is also very bad at naming things. We also talk about Cevat Yerli’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/28/crytek-reveals-the-many-faces-of-free-to-play?&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; that “…the notion of a single-player experience has to go away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1:02:15 – Round Table Discussion: Are the Elder Scrolls games getting better or worse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1:18:00 – We round out the podcast with the Assassin’s Creed 4 announcement. I hope you like pirates, because… uh… well I’m not really sure where the hell they’re going with this. Assassins and pirates? Are we going to finally see a video game about pirates versus ninjas? I don’t know, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3jKH5peHt8&quot;&gt;here’s the announcement trailer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;There’s this long-running joke among the Spoiler Warning cast. When we’re getting ready to record the show, we frequently get sidetracked talking about other stuff.  Sometimes for hours. Then eventually one of us will say, “You know what?

      <itunes:summary>There’s this long-running joke among the Spoiler Warning cast. When we’re getting ready to record the show, we frequently get sidetracked talking about other stuff.  Sometimes for hours. Then eventually one of us will say, “You know what? We should do a podcast.” This joke ran so long that we actually went and did it.

Embedded using HTML5. It either works or it doesn’t:

Discussion:

What’s everyone playing?Next gen backwards compatibility unlikely says random analyst.Last of Us Squeezes Every Last Drop of Power From PS3.FarCry 3 is a worse game than FarCry 2?Star Wars Free-for-all: Disney owns Star Wars, JJ Abrams directing next SW movie, Obsidian pitching new Star Wars game, and new Star Wars 1313 game.

The odds of us making more of these is directly proportional to how many people are interested in this one.
