Mumbles has really intense volume variations, from quiet whispers to explosive shouts. Josh’s hands-free setup results in occasional bits of background noise or sniffling that need to be silenced. And EVERYONE has different volume levels every week.)</p>
<p>So yeah. It’s harder than it seems.</p>

Show notes: 2:00 Gamespot hit with layoffs.

24:00 MAILTIME!

Here is one we didn’t cover on the show:

But it’s answered anyway. IT IS DONE.

I think the reason Josh questioned the authenticity of the above question is that we had just been talking about this before the show, and it seemed kind of convenient to have an email pop up on the same topic.

With regard to how we record audio: I know we discuss this every six months or so, but the topic keeps coming up and I don’t know what else to do.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode is a continuation of the same session as the previous Diecast. A side note about the recording of this episode is that – time zones being what they are – the sun was coming up for Jarenth when we finished recording this show, and at the same time it had only recently gone down for Josh. This might also explain why Jarenth isn’t as chatty as you were hoping.</p>

      <itunes:summary>This episode is a continuation of the same session as the previous Diecast. A side note about the recording of this episode is that – time zones being what they are – the sun was coming up for Jarenth when we finished recording this show, and at the same time it had only recently gone down for Josh. This might also explain why Jarenth isn’t as chatty as you were hoping.

Again, thanks for staying up so late to make these episodes happen.

Hosts: Josh, Shamus, Jarenth, and Krellen.

Show Notes:

0:30 Shamus is playing Bulletstorm.

Due to poor planning on my part, my full review of Bulletstorm already appeared earlier this week. So now you get the more rambling, less organized, I-haven’t-finished-it-yet version.

6:00 Krellen has played Unrest.

This section is spoiler-free.

7:00 Krellen is also playing Saints Row IV Co-op.

10:30 Krellen played through System Shock 2 for the first time ever last week.

27:00 Jarenth has been playing Frederic – Resurrection of Music.

Here is his writeup over on Ninja Blues.

33:30 Jarenth is also playing Magic 2015.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Double thanks to <a href="http://www.ninja-blues.com/">Jarenth</a> and <a href="http://krellen.net/">Krellen</a> for filling in at literally the last moment. If it hadn’t been for them, there wouldn’t be a Diecast this week.</p>
<p>Instead, you get two! The second half of this conversation will appear later in the week.</p>
<p>Hosts: <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/trollface-coolface-problem">Josh</a>, <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale">Shamus</a>, <a href="http://www.ninja-blues.com/">Jarenth</a>, and <a href="http://krellen.net/">Krellen</a>.</p>
<p>Show Notes:<br /> <span id="more-23847"></span></p>
<p><strong>1:30 News: <a href="http://variety.com/2014/digital/news/youtube-to-acquire-videogame-streaming-service-twitch-for-1-billion-sources-1201185204/">YouTube buys Twitch</a> for $LOLOL dollars.</strong></p>
<p><strong>11:00 Crytek’s <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2014/7/27/5941815/crytek-rumor-homefront-statement">ongoing financial problems</a>.</strong></p>
<p>We glossed over a point that I wanted to talk about in more detail: As Jarenth said, Crytek is known for making “really pretty” games. Or game engines. But we’re so far past the point of diminishing returns that their skills are basically moot. Think of it this way: Imagine the programmers at Crytek could suddenly make all their graphics run 50% faster. You can just hand-wave it and say a wizard makes it so that when running Cry Engine games, graphics cards have 50% more power.</p>
<p>I maintain that this benefit – even though it’s a complete miracle – would be of very limited business value. Homefront flopped, and that had nothing to do with its graphics. (In fact, I’m pretty sure the graphics were the only thing they got right. Which makes it even more mysterious as to why CryTek would bother with it.) When was the last time a game really sold on the basis of its graphics alone? AAA graphics are like pizza and sex: Even when they’re way below average, they’re still pretty great.</p>
<p><strong>27:00 The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/winterkewlgames/yogventures/posts">Yogventures Kickstarter</a> did not <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/07/17/yogscast-cancel-kickstarter-backed-yogventures-say-its-failure-is-a-deep-regret/">end well</a>.</strong></p>
<p>And here is the related mailbag question:</p>
<p>The Yogventures story is so sad. Half a million bucks, and very little to show for it other than a lot of rumors and finger-pointing. Contrast this with how the <a href="?p=23830" title="Unrest: An Honest Postmortem of a Kickstarter Success">Unrest kickstarter turned out</a>. This is not to rub salt in the Yogventures wound, but only to point out how important it is that these projects are transparent so that we can all learn from each other’s mistakes.</p>

<p>For the record: I joined in on the joke, but I actually think the fedora is a fine hat when worn in the right context. It’s gotten a bad reputation online from some people attempting to build their persona / establish a character around a simple hat, and it’s been rightfully maligned because some people insist on wearing them with otherwise casual clothing. A fedora is a “dress up” hat, not a “dress down” hat, and wearing it casually is like pairing a bowtie with an <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ed+Hardy+shirt&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS518US518&amp;es_sm=122&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZE7MU6OHB9agyAS214GwDw&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1192&amp;bih=760&amp;dpr=1.5">Ed Hardy shirt</a>.

<p>But if you don a fedora with proper slacks, a dress shirt, and a vest? Ignore the haters. That shit is <em>dapper</em>.</p>

<p><strong>19:00 We talk about food for no reason.</strong></p>
<p>I feel like a failure as a host. When Josh started talking about how the appendix was a vestigial organ, I was kind of torn.

Or do I let him go, thus increasing the number and intensity of the corrections in the comments? Maybe I made the wrong call. I guess we’ll see.</p>

      <itunes:summary>Just before this episode went live, Josh sent me a link to this, which is probably the most unsuitably high-quality image of Reginald Cuftburt ever produced. It’s like seeing a classical marble bust of Spongebob. Anyway, share it on Facebook or GeoCities or Angelfire. Or Tumbl it. Or Twit it. Whatever it is you young people do with data when you’re doing internet show-and-tell.

Hosts: Josh, Shamus, Mumbles, and Campster.

Show notes:

1:00 Shamus is playing Retro/Grade and Girls Like Robots.

Here are my original thought on Girls Like Robots after PAX 2012.

3:30 Shamus watched THE LEGO MOVIE.

Warning: Lengthy Batman conversation ensues. Here’s the Batman song we discussed. We also talk about Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man.

18:00 Mumbles is playing Divinity: Original Sin.

28:00 Chris has been playing Payday 2.

33:00 Chris has also been playing Valiant Hearts.

The rest of us haven’t played it. Here is what SuperBunnyHop has to say about it.

37:00 Chris has also been playing Dead Rising 3.

Wait, Dead Island 2 is being made by Yeager, the team behind Spec Ops: The Line? I have no idea how I feel about that. It’s either brilliant or idiotic.

46:00 Chis also got the Super Ultra Dead Rising 3′ Arcade Remix Hyper Edition EX + α.

That title is the kind of thing I make up to make fun of games with overly elaborate titles. Capcom knows all my moves, so they countered me by making a double ridiculous title. What am I supposed to do now? Make a triple ridiculous name? Or maybe reverse it and call the game “Dave”? Nah. I know when I’m beat.

You win this time, Capcom.

50:00 The challenges of having a large Steam library, buying games for making content, using footage from other people, fair use, YouTube culture, and Net Neutrality.

This is a little bit insider-y, but it’s the kind of stuff we worry about when shopping for games and making content.

Warning: Shamus becomes sad.

1:00:00 Mail time!

<p>Show notes:</p>
<p><span id="more-23506"></span><strong>01:00 Rutskarn has been playing…</strong></p>
<p>Oops, we cut him off for a discussion about <a href="https://www.origin.com/en-us/store/">Origin</a> vs. Steam vs. <a href="http://www.gog.com/">GoG</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll admit I’ve been totally unfair to Origin. They’re making modest, incremental progress into the market and as someone who has been publicly hounding them to change, I really ought to <strong>at least</strong> have the decency to check out their free games.</p>
<p><strong>05:00 Rutskarn has been playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor:_Allied_Assault">Medal of Honor: Allied Assault</a> and </strong> <a href="http://www.gog.com/game/syndicate">Syndicate</a>.</p>
<p>“Nameless Bob” is now my favorite character name.</p>
<p><strong>20:30 Shamus talks about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Typing_of_the_Dead">Typing of the Dead</a>.</strong></p>
<p>What you’ve heard here is true: I do not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing">touch-type</a>. That’s pretty ridiculous for someone who types for a living. It’s like a professional driver not knowing how to operate a manual transmission. At any rate, if you’re looking to learn to touch-type, Typing of the Dead is not a good place to start.</p>
<p>Note the 22 minute mark when I try to explain how long it’s been since I was 15 years old. Nothing will destroy your capacity to perform simple math like making calculations based on your own age. When the left half of your brain offers up the right answer, the right half of your brain will jump in with, “Ridiculous! It can’t possibly have been that long. It’s probably… half that. Yeah. Half-ish.”</p>
<p><strong>33:00 Shamus talks about <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seanyoung/magicite-a-multiplayer-rpg-platformer">Magicite</a>.</strong></p>
<p>As I’m doing this write-up, I’ve discovered that <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seanyoung/magicite-a-multiplayer-rpg-platformer">Magicite is a Kickstarted game</a>. I should also add that if you’ve got a background with 2D platformers (like if you grew up with the NES, as I’m sure is true of most of the target audience of this game) your experience will likely be very different than mine. If you’re competent with that type of gameplay then I do recommend giving this a look. It’s got tons of charm.</p>
<p><strong>39:00 Shamus is also playing Retro / Grade.</strong></p>
<p>This game is my drug. Much love.  Here’s a trailer:</p>

<p><strong>01:00 E3 Wrap-up.</strong></p>
<p>We say we don’t have anything left to say about E3, but then we talk about it for ten minutes. And since we brought up both Anthony Burch and panels, that gives me an excuse to link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm0rrGBin5Q">Dying is Funny, Comedy is Easy</a>, a presentation by Burch on why more games should embrace comedy.</p>
<p><strong>10:00 Watch_Dogs is a tone-deaf narrative with hackneyed characters.</strong></p>
<p>Chis and I talk about the game at length. Spoiler: It’s not our Game of the Year.</p>
<p><strong>19:00 Let’s talk about something else.</strong></p>
<p>Like the terrible Watch_Dogs gameplay.</p>
<p><strong>38:00 Somewhere along the line we lose the plot and talk about Ubisoft and Elder Scrolls.</strong></p>
<p>We didn’t even plan to discuss Elder Scrolls this week. It just happened.</p>
<p><strong>50:00 Steam Summer Sale!</strong></p>
<p>Actually, while we were going to talk about the sale for this segment, we just wound up talking about what we’re playing. Go figure.</p>
<p>Chris is playing <a href="http://amon26.itch.io/in-the-kingdom">In the Kingdom</a> and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/games/killer-instinct#fbid=B0Qlpcntr1O">Killer Instinct</a>.</p>
<p>I’m playing <a href="http://riskofraingame.com/">Risk of Rain</a>. Also <a href="http://www.puppygames.net/revenge-of-the-titans/">Revenge of the Titans</a> from <a href="http://www.puppygames.net/">Puppygames</a>. In this segment I said I had all the titles from Puppygames. Not so! They now have <a href="http://www.puppygames.net/droid-assault/">Droid Assault</a>, which is part of the Steam sale at the moment.

      <title>Diecast #61: Video Editing, Nintendo’s Cut, Watch_Dogs</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We’re proud to present this hour of podcast, which is completely free of anyone talking about Dark Souls. You’re welcome. However, I now own Dark Souls, so one of these days we’re going to have <em>that</em> conversation. You have not gained your freedom. Only a reprieve.</p>
<p>Show notes: <span id="more-23244"></span><br /> <strong>1:00 Shamus is Playing Wolfenstein: The New Order.</strong></p>
<p>But I’m only a couple of hours in and don’t have anything to say about it yet.</p>
<p><strong>1:30 Josh is looking into video editing software.</strong></p>
<p>So is Chris. And Shamus.</p>
<p><strong>14:30 Mumbles talks about how <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/05/27/nintendo-revenue-sharing/">Nintendo has decided to take a cut of let’s plays and streamers.</a></strong></p>
<p>I should have pointed out: Lots of streamers and LP-ers are moving to Flattr, PayPal, and Patreon. What happens when everyone is posting ad-free videos and there’s nothing for Nintendo to take? How is YouTube going to respond to this move that indirectly makes their service even <em>more</em> unprofitable by encouraging us peasants to not monetize?</p>
<p>This could get strange.</p>
<p><strong>23:00 Mumbles is playing Transistor.</strong></p>
<p><strong>25:30 Chris is playing Watch_Dogs.</strong></p>

      <itunes:summary>We’re proud to present this hour of podcast, which is completely free of anyone talking about Dark Souls. You’re welcome. However, I now own Dark Souls, so one of these days we’re going to have that conversation. You have not gained your freedom. Only a reprieve.

Show notes:  1:00 Shamus is Playing Wolfenstein: The New Order.

But I’m only a couple of hours in and don’t have anything to say about it yet.

1:30 Josh is looking into video editing software.

So is Chris. And Shamus.

14:30 Mumbles talks about how Nintendo has decided to take a cut of let’s plays and streamers.

I should have pointed out: Lots of streamers and LP-ers are moving to Flattr, PayPal, and Patreon. What happens when everyone is posting ad-free videos and there’s nothing for Nintendo to take? How is YouTube going to respond to this move that indirectly makes their service even more unprofitable by encouraging us peasants to not monetize?

This could get strange.

23:00 Mumbles is playing Transistor.

25:30 Chris is playing Watch_Dogs.

30:00 LUDONARRATIVE DISSONANCE

Aw yeah. That’s the stuff.

37:00 Chris is now the proudBut not really. owner of an Xbox One.

44:00 MAILBAG!

1:30 Chris talks about Wolfenstein: The New Order

Here are the Polygon articles Chris mentioned:

Wolfenstein is the rare game that shows sex as both fun and healing

Wolfenstein: The New Order shows you the horror of concentration camps from the first-person.

16:00 Shamus had a fight with Google.

The post is down until I get this sorted out, although you can see the original text here. You can decide for yourself if that qualifies as outrageous adult content. For contrast, here is the Call of Roma ad that was repeatedly deemed okay by Google under the same standards. Which means Google was regularly putting stuff on my site that was – by any reasonable measure – far more offensive than what they banned me for. And in both cases I was denied any way to tell them their system was malfunctioning.

Running a Patreon campaign is a big deal for me. It’s going to take me a little while to set it up. I’ll talk more about this once I figure out what I’m doing.

28:00 A digression on various obnoxious / annoying / “evil” internet companies, from Google to Amazon.

This is what made me dislike Amazon, and question if our patent system does objectively more damage than good in the world.

39:00 Mumbles talks about Bombshell and female characters created by female designers.

49:00 Shamus and Mumble hijack things and talk comics for a bit.

We talk about Punisher, Dr. Strange, and The Superior Foes of Spider-Man. Tragically, TSFoSM isn’t yet available on Marvel Unlimited. At least, I think it isn’t. Their search functionality and catalog indexing is atrocious.

EDIT: I found it. Their own search engine was useless. Google took me right to it.

54:00 Chris and Josh talk about Transistor.

Show notes:

1:30 Bombshell

Behold the Bombshell site, in all its kitschy glory. Maybe they’re serious. Maybe it’s ironic. It’s definitely unapologetic.

The whole thing eventually degrades into yet another ride on the “what do we REALLY think of Duke Nukem?” rollercoaster.

25:00 DARK SOULS 2

If you only listen to one 80′s sitcom-style song about Dark Souls 2, make sure it’s THIS one!

30:00 If one Marvel hero was set up on a blind date with one DC hero, what would be the most interesting pairing?

35:00 Talking about Dark Souls 2 again.

48:00 Shamus and Mumbles talk comic books.

1:03:00 Mumbles is playing Diablo III for Xbox.

<p>Really? The game is just called “Jurassic Park”? Not “Jurassic Park: Mobile” or “Jurassic Park: Reviving Previously Extinct Species to have them Fight to the Death in a sick and Decadent Pit-Fight in the Name of Animal Cruelty Because Obviously”?

<p>Okay then.</p>
<p><strong>9:00 Chris is playing <a href="http://rustysrealdealbaseball.nintendo.com/">Rusty’s Real Deal Baseball</a>.</strong></p>

But in my book he’s like Michael Bay except he knows to to make a movie. It might be cheap, disposable entertainment, but at least it holds together as a cohesive story with proper character beats.

<p>This might be for the best. Abrams strikes me as not the best person to manage the intersection of dozens of films and books.

      <itunes:summary>I wasn’t on the show this week because I was sick and had…

[two paragraphs of lengthy bitching and moaning redacted]

…until it all turned green and fell off. But I’m nearly back to normal now. In the meantime, the kids did the show without me. I’m listening to the show for the first time as I write this, so we’re going to experience this together.

Let’s do this:

Hosts: Josh, Rutskarn, Chris, and Mumbles.

Show notes:

2:00 Chris has entered the strange world of mobile gaming. He’s playing Jurassic Park.

Really? The game is just called “Jurassic Park”? Not “Jurassic Park: Mobile” or “Jurassic Park: Reviving Previously Extinct Species to have them Fight to the Death in a sick and Decadent Pit-Fight in the Name of Animal Cruelty Because Obviously”? Nothing to distinguish it from the movie, or the hundreds of other games that have also failed to do justice to the Jurassic Park mythos? No?

Okay then.

9:00 Chris is playing Rusty’s Real Deal Baseball.

18:30 Mumbles has been learning The Console Gaming.

Specifically, she’s been playing Earth Defense Force 2017. After that she’s going to play Asura’s Wrath, which I gather is a videogame of some sort.

29:00 Apparently we digressed into Hearthstone at some point? That’s the new card game thing, right?

32:00 Josh is playing Dark Souls 2 and Stronghold Kingdoms.

40:00 Rutskarn is playing Planescape Torment.

For the record: Yes, I played through Planescape Torment. You lightweights.

48:00 The Star Wars Extended Universe is not recognized as canon by Disney.

I am not surprised by this. J.J. Abrams rebooted ALL OF STAR TREK, and I suspect it was partly because he didn’t want to have to do a hundred hours of research every time someone pushed a button in the movie. He’s not my first choice for either franchise, and he’s never going to give us a Wrath of Khan or an Empire Strikes Back. But in my book he’s like Michael Bay except he knows to to make a movie. It might be cheap, disposable entertainment, but at least it holds together as a cohesive story with proper character beats. And I’ll take ridiculous LENS FLARE over incomprehensible, puke-inducing shaky-cam any day.

Hang on. After I typed that last paragraph I remembered that Abrams just made Star Trek Into Darkness, and it did try to re-create Wrath of Khan, and it wasn’t a cohesive story at all. I haven’t watched it, but that’s what I heard, anyway. Did I just bolster my position before destroying it? I don’t know. I report. You deride.

ANYWAY.

This might be for the best. Abrams strikes me as not the best person to manage the intersection of dozens of films and books. He’s not a detail guy, and he would probably just infuriate fans if he actually tried to build on existing extended universe canon. It’s far better for him to be up front and honest about what he’s doing so we can go in with our expectations properly calibrated.

1:00:00 Shouldn’t the show be about over by now? Are we still talking about Star Wars?

NERDS!

1:03:00 Josh isn’t kidding. Here is the guy with the ice cream maker.

Also, still talking about Star Wars.

1:08:00 We’re talking about Guy Fieri now. For some reason.

I had no idea who this guy was until Chris brought him up.

Star Wars and Homestuck and Guy Fieri?!? What is happening?

Also, there is Homestuck spoilers in this segment. Whatever THAT means.

1:11:00 CURSE YOU JOSH!

Here is the image Rutskarn shared at the end of the show. You’re… welcome?

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Hey, guys, it’s Rutskarn. This story speaks for itself–it’s about a total shitshow of a GM who ran the most incompetent campaign I’ve ever participated in. It is not the worst campaign I’ve ever <i>heard</i> of, but to clear that hurdle it’d need to involve literal felonies, so never mind.</p>
<p>Hosts: <a href="http://www.jamesonwhiskey.com/us/agegate">Josh</a>, <a href="http://www.chocolatehammer.org/">Rutskarn</a>, and <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale">Shamus</a>.</p>
<p>Just in case your palate needs scrubbing, I’ll be around to answer any questions about running or playing tabletop roleplaying games that you’ve got for me in the comments. I’ve got hundreds of hours of GMing experience (in fact, nearly a hundred hours of experience GMing <em>only at charity events</em>), so generally speaking I know what I’m talking about.</p>
<p>Ask whatever you’d like. I should get to most of them within a day or so, but I’ll plug away until I’ve hit ‘em all.</p>

Ask whatever you’d like. I should get to most of them within a day or so, but I’ll plug away until I’ve hit ‘em all.

<p><strong>13:00 Chris is also playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qsdIveYJ0Y">Actual Sunlight</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Interesting that this is the <a href="http://www.depressionquest.com/">second</a> game about depression I’ve run into in the last few months.</p>
<p>Personal talk:</p>
<p>I’ve had days where I woke up and found I couldn’t feel joy or happiness or even contentment. Where nothing felt worth doing. The usual fire I had to consume and talk about games (or do anything else) was just… <em>gone</em>. There was never any reason for this. Everything was fine in my life, aside from the fact that my mood was unaccountably mis-calibrated. I don’t know that this is anything like the clinical depression that some people talk about, but I use it as a frame of reference. My episodes always blow over after a few days and don’t linger for weeks or months on end.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether this is depression or not, it’s certainly an interesting phenomena. We tend to assume that our moods are linked to our situations, and it can be completely baffling and frustrating when that connection is broken. <em>I have no reason to be sad right now. So why am I sad?</em></p>
<p>Having never played either game myself, I do wonder what the intent behind them is. Are they a way for people suffering from depression to feel some sort of connection with each other? Is this a way of saying “You are not alone” to others? Or is this intended to share the experience with people who have never been through it and don’t understand what it’s like?</p>
<p>I wish I’d asked Chris during the show, but I’d love to hear from anyone who has played either game.</p>
<p><strong>15:00 Shamus is working on programming. But not Good Robot.</strong></p>
<p>Stuff I’m working on / thinking about:</p>
<p>1) GLSL shading language. 2) Systems which are incredibly robust with regards to consistency of framerate. 3) Different techniques for offloading CPU work onto the graphics card.</p>
<p>Maybe we’ll talk about this later in the week. Maybe not. I still need to finish my write-up on Thief.</p>
<p><strong>16:00 <a href="http://www.civilization.com/#trailer">Civilization: Beyond Earth</a> has been announced. So we spend a bunch of time talking about Alpha Centauri.</strong></p>
<p>This topic gets derailed by religion in games. If you want to skip that, jump ahead to somewhere around the 37 minute mark.</p>
<p><strong>26:00 Surprise mid-podcast mailbag!</strong></p>
<p><strong>34:00 We talk about Jade Empire.</strong></p>
<p><strong>37:00 And back to Civilization.</strong></p>
<p><strong>44:00 Mailbag!</strong></p>

41:00 GTA is “Ugly”.

Just to avoid any potential fan-rage, let me make it clear that I’m not talking about graphics. When I say GTA is ugly I’m talking about the nasty heart of the game, which seems to hate everything, even its own despicable lead[s].

45:00 Project Greelight is being discontinued, and replaced with anarchy.

Here is the Errant Signal that Chris made about Greenlight when it was introduced back in 2012.

<p>It’s hard to stop talking about this subject once you get started. For me the compelling thing is the completely anarchic and asymmetrical nature of the debate.

Then there are angry people who think that sexy characters are inherently destructive and that enjoying some T&amp;A makes you a horrible person. Then the other side fails to draw a distinction between these two positions and hilarity ensues. Add in a handful of really ugly, Angry Young Men who spew hate and threats.

Add in a couple of layers of counter-backlash to either side and suddenly it’s really hard to understand how such a simple idea can generate so much outrage.</p>
<p>This complete mayhem creates a desire from people like me to clear up this confusion.

Note that we had this conversation before I did the homework for <a href="?p=22139">my recent EVE post</a>.</p>
<p><strong>28:00 We move on from EVE and talk about space games more broadly.</strong></p>

<p><strong>51:30 Chris is writing things and talking about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbv9rs9bVOE">Alien Isolation</a>.</strong></p>
<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien:_Isolation">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<p>Whaaat?</p>
<p>So you’re playing as Ripley’s daughter. Who is an adult. Not only does this muck with establish canon, but it drags in a character that was better left where she was: Having lived a perfectly mundane and unremarkable life on Earth.</p>
<p>A much better idea? Let us play as Newt. You wouldn’t have to screw with any existing lore, and the mechanics are all right there in the movie: Newt survives by hiding in tight spots and using her wits. She can crawl through the duct work and watch the Aliens tear through the colonists. We’ve got a huge installation to work with and lots of blank space on the timeline. It would be a very cat-and-mouse type stealth, where the tension comes from the times when you’re obliged to leave the safety of the vents and venture into the open to accomplish something.</p>
<p>I’m not saying it can’t be a great game, but the whole “Ripley’s daughter” thing smacks of ham-handed fanfiction.</p>
<p>Having said that: This is the first Alien game in ages that sounds promising. Survival stealth? Oh yeah. I’m on board with that.</p>

So you’re playing as Ripley’s daughter. Who is an adult. Not only does this muck with establish canon, but it drags in a character that was better left where she was: Having lived a perfectly mundane and unremarkable life on Earth.

<p><strong>0:00 Josh has Jellybeans.</strong></p>
<p>Aside: Last year I watched <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/371272">Candyman: The David Klein Story</a>. (That link goes to Hulu where you can watch it for free.) It’s interesting and a little sad. It also made me want to eat candy, so watch out for that.</p>
<p><strong>2:00 Rutskarn is playing the Saints Row 4.</strong></p>
<p>We talk about the series, compare the humor to GTA, discuss the the “romance scenes”, and talk about choice and Mass Effect.</p>
<p><strong>17:30 Chris is playing <a href="http://continue9876543210.com/">Continue?9876543421</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>28:00 Shamus is playing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m7rmb3QrN8">The Novelist</a>.</strong></p>
<p>This is a game all about balancing creative work with family life. Like I said in the show: I found a lot of meaning in the game, but it depicts a problem we spent years dealing with. I’m curious if it holds the same appeal for someone that hasn’t been through this.</p>
<p><strong>42:00 Josh is playing the <a href="http://www.worldofys.com/ysc/">Ys Chronicles</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>46:00 Rutskarn recaps the <a href="http://forthechildrenandstuff.tumblr.com/">Aunty Paladins</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Rutskarn spins us a yarn of how the stream went and shares some of the highlights.</p>
<p><strong>1:02:00 Chris talks about his <a href="http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/?p=603">Patreon campaign</a>.</strong></p>
<p>I find this <em>incredibly encouraging</em>. I might give this topic a post of its own, but the short version is that by sponsoring a show directly, the money ends up in the hands of the people who make the content we love. Compare this to the old model where:</p>
<ol><li>Acme buys advertising space on YouTube.<p></p></li><li>The ad runs on a video made by Bob.</li><li>Carla clicks on the ad. (Probably by accident, if my own surfing habits are any indication.)</li><li>YouTube gives a tiny little bit of the advertising money to Bob.</li></ol>
<p>And all too often:</p>
<ol><li value="5">Actually, some jackass copyright troll flags Bob as producing infringing content and siphons off some of his revenue while Bob spends time disputing the claim instead of making more content.</li></ol>
<p>Acme can’t tell where their ad shows up or who will see it in this madcap YouTube world.  YouTube doesn’t care about the quality of Bob’s show as long as people watch it. Bob doesn’t care about Acme as long as he gets his money. When Carla clicks, it’s not because she likes Bob’s show, but because she’s ostensibly interested in Acme. The parties all have goals that are either completely unrelated or even in conflict.</p>
<p>It’s an awful system, and the only reason we’re using it is because we don’t have anything better. Services like Subbable and Patreon might be a way to route around this madness.</p>
<p>Like Errant Signal? Want to encourage it? <a href="http://www.patreon.com/errantsignal">You can support it here</a>. And as Chris is quick to say: <em>The show will continue whether you give or not.</em> Giving is your way of saying, “Dear internet. Make more stuff like this.”</p>

Aside: Last year I watched Candyman: The David Klein Story. (That link goes to Hulu where you can watch it for free.) It’s interesting and a little sad. It also made me want to eat candy, so watch out for that.

2:00 Rutskarn is playing the Saints Row 4.

We talk about the series, compare the humor to GTA, discuss the the “romance scenes”, and talk about choice and Mass Effect.

17:30 Chris is playing Continue?9876543421.

28:00 Shamus is playing The Novelist.

This is a game all about balancing creative work with family life. Like I said in the show: I found a lot of meaning in the game, but it depicts a problem we spent years dealing with. I’m curious if it holds the same appeal for someone that hasn’t been through this.

42:00 Josh is playing the Ys Chronicles.

46:00 Rutskarn recaps the Aunty Paladins.

Rutskarn spins us a yarn of how the stream went and shares some of the highlights.

1:02:00 Chris talks about his Patreon campaign.

I find this incredibly encouraging. I might give this topic a post of its own, but the short version is that by sponsoring a show directly, the money ends up in the hands of the people who make the content we love. Compare this to the old model where:

Acme buys advertising space on YouTube.The ad runs on a video made by Bob.Carla clicks on the ad. (Probably by accident, if my own surfing habits are any indication.)YouTube gives a tiny little bit of the advertising money to Bob.

And all too often:

Actually, some jackass copyright troll flags Bob as producing infringing content and siphons off some of his revenue while Bob spends time disputing the claim instead of making more content.

Acme can’t tell where their ad shows up or who will see it in this madcap YouTube world.  YouTube doesn’t care about the quality of Bob’s show as long as people watch it. Bob doesn’t care about Acme as long as he gets his money. When Carla clicks, it’s not because she likes Bob’s show, but because she’s ostensibly interested in Acme. The parties all have goals that are either completely unrelated or even in conflict.

It’s an awful system, and the only reason we’re using it is because we don’t have anything better. Services like Subbable and Patreon might be a way to route around this madness.

Like Errant Signal? Want to encourage it? You can support it here. And as Chris is quick to say: The show will continue whether you give or not. Giving is your way of saying, “Dear internet. Make more stuff like this.”

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Happy new year! Rather than doing a big year-end retrospective, we talked about the here &amp; now like we usually do.</p>
<p>Note that I produced this episode. Josh usually does it, but he’s visiting his parents and doesn’t have access to his normal equipment. So any complaints about the audio quality should be directed at me. Note also that I make about two episodes a year, so your complaints won’t do any good because I end up re-learning the whole process from scratch every time.</p>

<p>To be clear, I don’t know if gargling with alcohol is medically useful for killing throat-based infections, but it FEELS like it helps. The only reason I doubt it is: If all you needed to do to kill throat cultures was gargle alcohol, wouldn’t they have figured it out ages ago? Wouldn’t this just be standard procedure for sore throats?</p>
<p>As an aside: How could you do a proper <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment">double-blind</a> study on this? With most tests, you can easily administer a placebo without detection. But the test subject is going to feel that alcohol in their throat and the control subject won’t, and that sensation is going to skew the results. I don’t know. I  think the best solution is for us to make a field trip to the liquor store and begin what I’m calling a “blind drunk trial”.</p>
<p>Given how good it feels, I can’t believe this treatment doesn’t go all the way back to the middle ages.</p>
<p><strong>8:30 Josh got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_TIE_Fighter">Tie Fighter</a> working on his tablet, using a 360 controller with <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/">Dos Box</a>.</strong></p>
<p>This is madness. Awesome madness.</p>
<p><strong>9:00 Josh is playing <a href="http://projectzomboid.com/">Project Zomboid</a></strong></p>
<p>We throw out the term “offsite SVN” without explaining it.  For the record, SVN is a system for keeping track of source code. An offsite one is a place where you can upload your code so that even if your computer gets hit by an asteroid, you still have a complete record of your code, your documentation, and the history of the project. VERY useful. I use <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a>.</p>
<p>Also, I claimed I was a “one man operation”, which is completely untrue. I have Peter Olson going over my revisions and making sure it all works on Linux.</p>
<p><strong>19:00 Chris is playing <a href="http://www.pinballarcade.com/GetItNow/">The Pinball Arcade</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.game.simpsons4_na">Simpsons: Tapped Out</a>.</strong></p>

But when you’re talking about something made by half a dozen people, it all becomes kind of personal and I’m shy of eviscerating something on that level.

But sometimes you have to give a game the thrashing it deserves. This week is a reckoning for a handful of misbegotten indies.

Hosts: Rutskarn, Josh, Mumbles, Chris, and Shamus.

Show notes:

1:30 Josh played Home.

In the process of discussing the game and the horror genre in general, we talk about 7th Guest and the recent 7th Guest 3 Kickstarter.

20:00 Chris is playing Batman: Arkham Origins and Battlefield 4.

We also spend some time talking about good ol’ Team Fortress 2 and how the game has changed.

35:00 Shamus has been playing indie games. The Void, Spelunky, and Eldrich.

Of these three games: He praises one, complains about a second, and hates on the third. But not in that order.

49:00 Mumbles has been playing Batman: Arkham Origins.

Here is an in-depth discussion about the new Batman game from Mumbles.

1:00:00 Rutkarn has played The Wolf Among Us and Typing of the Dead: Overkill.

Here is the story about how Typing of the Dead was made (sort of) in six weeks, salvaged by a team that believed in it.

<p><strong>1:00 Shamus is annoyed with how the game Brothers ended.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SPOILERS!</strong> We go on to compare other well-known downer endings and talk about what makes an ending work and what doesn’t. We talk about The Walking Dead, Mass Effect 3, and Brothers. It was impossible to have this conversation without a few spoilers.</p>
<p>I still recommend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers:_A_Tale_of_Two_Sons">Brothers</a>, and I recommend spoiling the ending first.</p>

<p>In talking about Dreamfall, I referenced <a href="?p=682">my old rant on the end of the game</a>. Check it out:</p>
<p>Correct on all counts. I’m 42, my daughter is about to turn 16, and I barely remember the game aside from being angry at the end. Also relevant is <a href="?p=1006">this ancient post on why I dislike episodic games</a>.</p>

(I called it “Kairos” throughout this segment. In my defense, a friend of mine owned a coffee shop called Kairos and saying “Kairo” is like trying to say “Borderland”. It’s hard to make my mouth stop before the s!) But mostly coding.</p>
<p>Rutskarn is playing the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble Origin Bundle</a>.</p>

<p><strong>20:00 What is you opinion of game design colleges?</strong></p>
<p><strong>38:00 Why are games so obsessed with using “ruins” as gameplay space?</strong></p>

      <itunes:summary>Special episode this week.  There’s no news we care to talk about, so we’re answering mailbag questions. Note that I’ve paraphrased the questions in the show notes because I don’t want to transcribe the originals.

Hosts: Chris, Josh, Rutskarn and Shamus.

Show notes:

1:00 What’s everyone playing?

Chris is playing Rogue Legacy, Animal Crossing, and Civilization V: Brave New World.

Rutskarn is writing for Unrest and playing Sleeping Dogs. He’s also looking for a job making words for a living.

Shamus has been playing Titan Attacks and Ultratron from indie developer Puppygames. Also programming.

Josh is playing Metro: Last Light.

20:00 What is you opinion of game design colleges?

38:00 Why are games so obsessed with using “ruins” as gameplay space?

There was a sub-question directed at me, which we forgot about. So I’ll answer it here in the show notes. The question was, “Why do you like Spiderman?”

I fell in love with Spiderman because he was the first superhero that felt real or relatable to me. Batman was a millionaire playboy. Superman was a handsome invincible saint from another planet. Wonder Woman was a warrior princess of the Amazons. Thor was a Norse God.

But Spiderman was a “regular” guy and when he took off the mask he had regular guy problems. He wasn’t rich, or famous, or popular. He had to buy his groceries and take out the garbage just like everyone else.

47:00 What do you think about “benign deaths” in videogames like BioShock, Prey, RAGE, and Borderlands?

<p>This week we had nothing. Not one news story. I don’t know if we weren’t following the news or we didn’t care, but we had no stories and nothing to say.

Just so you know what you’re getting into. In any case, the choice was between this and nothing.</p>

<p><strong>00:30</strong> We join the podcast in mid-conversation, talking about <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1022603/">500 Days of Summer</a> and Scott Pilgrim.

<p>If you’ve got a question for the cast, send it to diecast@shamusyoung.com. Also: Short questions make for better launching points for conversation. Long questions are better left in the comments.

And then we spend several minutes talking about Minecraft mods because I wasn’t sure if people wanted to talk about Minecraft mods.

23:00 It’s the triumphant return of “Bad SimCity News of the week”! You can get free SimCity DLC by buying specially-marked boxes of toothpaste or whatever. At least it’s not Doritos and Mountain Dew this time.

33:20 The developer of the MMO Salem creates a definition of the word “game”. Shocking turn: He crafts a definition specifically to favor things he likes and exclude things he doesn’t.

During the discussion, I brought up Realm of the Mad God, which was the basis for the recent Spoiler Warning joke title Realm of the Bad Dog, which nobody noticed. Alas. Also we discussed (and made fun of) Peter Molyneux’s Curiosity – What’s Inside the Cube?

45:30 Cevat Yerli, the CEO of Crytek, says that graphics are “60% of the game”.

(For the archive archaeologists out there, the posts Shamus wrote about this game in 2006 can be found here.)

Chris is playing Torchlight 2, Super Hexagon, Dishonored DLC.

      <itunes:summary>And it’s another one of these things that we seem to be doing.

01:30 What’s everyone doing?

Josh is watching movies. When I said “Liam Neesons” it was a reference to this Key &amp; Peele sketch.

Chris is playing Kingdoms of Amalur, and various flavors of Tomb Raider and Uncharted.

Rutskarn has once again run aground on Knights of the Old Republic II. He’s also playing Fallout: New Vegas with ALL THE MODS.

Shamus is playing Antichamber and Tomb Raider.  We talked about Adventure for the Atari 2600. You can actually play that in a browser window these days. He’s also playing Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed. No really. (And this is the Football Manager game we referenced.)

26:30 SIM CITY IS STILL A STORY WHEN WILL THE NIGHTMARE END?

Here is a partial list of stupid, broken problems in SimCity from Rock, Paper, Shotgun. And another at The Escapist.

Here is a video demonstrating how you can build a massive city with only residential zoning. No jobs. No places to buy things. No public services. Nothing. And it grows to a massive size.

Here is the initial glowing review of SimCity on Polygon that was later altered.

45:00 Saint’s Row 4 Trailer

The trailer we’re talking about is this one:

And here’s the Deadpool Trailer that gets dragged into the discussion.

54:15 Tress FX in Tomb Raider

Here is a video of Tress FX in action.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We should probably title these things or something. I mean, if we’re going to keep making episodes then at some point we’ll be like, “Wait. Which one did we discuss playing through Half-Life 2: Episode 3? Was that Diecast #230? No, 230 was when we discussed Sony’s inexplicable decision to design the Playstation 5 with a cotton-candy pink case.”</p>
<p>Then again, I have no idea how to title long multi-topic discussions in a memorable way. Screw it. We’ll just kick this problem on down the road and let future-us deal with it.</p>
<p>Show notes:</p>
<p><strong>00:15</strong> Intro. What’s everyone doing?  Shamus is playing Max Payne 3. (I suppose I might as well link to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU0dgjon10U" title="A Day in the Life of Max Payne">that one Max Payne video</a> before someone beats me to it.) Rutskarn is playing KOTOR2. Chris is playing <a href="https://www.digipen.edu/?id=1170&amp;proj=25930">Perspective</a>. Josh is playing…</p>
<p><strong>17:00</strong> Tomb Raider. The new one. Like, the reboot. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCKHlO9C7Lc">This one</a>.</p>
<p><strong>40:00</strong> SimCity. Man, does this story have legs or what? We recorded this on Sunday night, and here on Thursday the follies continue. Sadly, this means a lot of the stuff we discussed or speculated about has now been resolved or rendered moot, only to be replaced by new failures. The latest? <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/03/12/simcity-server-not-necessary/" title="Maxis Insider Tells RPS: SimCity Servers Not Necessary">Maxis Insider Tells RPS: SimCity Servers Not Necessary</a>.</p>
<p>This reminds me so much of the ages-old <a href="?p=1290" title="Bioshock: Miss Misinformation">BioShock controversy</a>: A polite spokeswoman is way out of her technical depth and saying things that the tech-savvy users prove to be untrue, thus making inflaming the people they were trying to pacify. Those who do not learn from history, etc. (They are also repeating the mistakes of the Diablo III launch and the Assassin’s Creed 2 launch. So, nice going EA. You are the very last idiot to make this particular blunder.)</p>
<p><strong>1:03:30</strong> The Blip.tv story. <a href="http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/?p=467" title="Errant Signal">Here is what Chris posted about it</a>. And here is the original post where I hurled bricks at the company after too many trips through the same advertisement: <a href="?p=12158" title="Blip.TV Sucks">Blip.tv Sucks</a>. Stay classy, Shamus.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>With Shamus out for the week, I host and Jarenth guest stars on this exciting installment of the Diecast!</p>
<p>And now for the show notes, complete with the oft-requested timestamps!</p>
<p>00:15 – We talk about what we’ve been doing for the past week. Shamus is a zombie, Chris is a Tomb Raider, Rutskarn is Homestuck, Jarenth’s lost in Echo Bazaar, and I’ve been set on the Path of Exile.</p>
<p>15:55 – Everything and more about the Playstation 4 announcement, and in particular, the implication that “more polygons = stronger emotional connection.” And if you don’t want to watch the whole thing, VideoGamerTV made a helpful <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJDn0jRnUQ">abridged version of the conference</a> that has basically everything that’s important in it.</p>
<p>33:00 – We discuss the closure of Civilization World and what it can tell us about the state of Social Games, and how it compares to a similar collapse of the MMO space.</p>
<p>48:00 – Crytek jumps on the free-to-play bandwagon and is also very bad at naming things. We also talk about Cevat Yerli’s <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/28/crytek-reveals-the-many-faces-of-free-to-play?">statement</a> that “…the notion of a single-player experience has to go away.”</p>
<p>1:02:15 – Round Table Discussion: Are the Elder Scrolls games getting better or worse?</p>
<p>1:18:00 – We round out the podcast with the Assassin’s Creed 4 announcement. I hope you like pirates, because… uh… well I’m not really sure where the hell they’re going with this. Assassins and pirates? Are we going to finally see a video game about pirates versus ninjas? I don’t know, but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3jKH5peHt8">here’s the announcement trailer.</a></p>
