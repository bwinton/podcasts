        <![CDATA[
		<p>Happy Gluttony and Awkward Relatives Day! Hope you had a good one. We cheated and got take-out for Thanksgiving. A decade ago, that would have been an unthinkable breach of TRADITION. But now my wife and I are middle-age and we’re more or less in charge of what traditions get observed, passed on, ignored, or altered. And I think we’ve decided that a whole bunch of take-out is a better way to observe the day than hours of cooking food that isn’t anyone’s favorite, followed by hours of cleaning.</p>

00:00 Thanksgiving

So it turns out it’s been four years since I saw my oldest two kids. That’s way too long.

06:17 Carrion



I love this game. 

14:50 Elite Dangerous




This reminds me: It’s been a while since the last installment of Terrible / Sketchy Star Citizen News. Has that game reformed, died, or gone underground? I feel like we’re still waiting for the other shoe to drop.

26:38 Watchdogs Legion

Like we asked on the show: Who’s playing this? Any interest in an analysis?

29:43 Teardown



36:57 For the King



47:18 Hades on Steam

Several people emailed, asking about this game. I’m not sure why so many were curious about this particular game, but for the record: Nothing against it, but I don’t think it’s going to reach the top of the playlist soon. 

48:12 Mailbag: Writing for games is hard.

Dear Diecast,
I was recently listening to a Podcast interview on Tested.com with Adam Savage speaking with guest Evan Narcisse who if you are unfamiliar is/was a reporter for Kotaku but also the writer on a recent Black Panther comic mini-series. In the interview he discusses adapting  to writing for an unnamed video game and how it’s like ‘trying to put a saddle on a hurricane’ in that things keep getting changed around with the design. It has me wondering if this sort of fluidity is the source of some of the incongruities and shortcomings you so love to point out in your breakdowns of games like Spider Man.

        <![CDATA[
		<p>This week I talked to <a href="http://www.seventh-house.org/about/">Ross Zevenhuizen</a>, a friend, collaborator on <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=29669">Good Robot</a>, and one of the developers of <em>Watch Dogs Legion</em>. We didn’t make it clear at the top of the show, but Ross is under some annoying NDA restrictions that prevents him from speaking freely about the development process. We were able to talk openly about <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=33233">our mistakes and regrets</a> in Good Robot, but this is an Ubisoft game and we’re obliged to play by Ubisoft’s rules.</p>

Show notes: 

00:00 Welcome Ross

I do think we need to have Ross back to talk about his other projects and Unity development in general.

02:31 Ross is credited as “Level designer”

Not sure why they don’t just create the job title “Mission Designer”.

08:45 The Three Pillars

Combat, stealth, and hacking. There’s also car driving, some multiplayer stuff, and eighty metric tons of collectibles on the map, but combat, stealth, and hacking are the meat of the game. 

13:56 Why was the Daybreak storyline the only one to end with a choice?

The best (and most vividly Cyberpunk) story in the game was the shortest, and the only one to end with a choice. It kinda felt like a classic BioWare-style RPG for a few minutes.

28:59 Working on indie scale vs AAA.

33:05 Are these characters randomly generated, or pulled from a prefab list?

They’re random. Ross talks a bit about how they’re generated.

36:07 Amazing recruits







40:01 Recruits wear their default clothes around the base. Was that a technical limitation, or a design choice?

It really is disappointing and confusing.

41:56 The problems of repeating missions.

Not so much a problem for me, but some people report doing the same mission several times. Have I been lucky or were they unlucky?

46:41 The problems / challenges with trying to make London “Cyberpunk”.

C’mon, Ubi! The premise is Cyberpunk. Embrace it. This “real world” looking stuff is for those squares a Rockstar. Make up a fake city and go crazy!

54:40 The tone

I’ve always wondered about this. Ross gives some hints about how AAA games can sometimes feel a little disjointed. It turns out this studio has WAY less top-down structure than I ever would have guessed.

<p><strong>00:00 Maybe Ross Next Week</strong></p>
<p>We’ll see. </p>
<p><strong>01:08 Homestar and the Death of Flash</strong></p>
<p>The characters themselves remarked on the death of Flash <a href="http://www.hrwiki.org/wiki/Flash_is_Dead!">five years ago</a>. I think Chrome is the only browser that will allow you to see the originals in all of their vector-animated glory.</p>
<p>An entire art form vanishing into the bit bucket. Alas. </p>
<p>Then again, there’s something satisfying about seeing atrocious broken software meet its well-deserved end. Bethesda has spent the last decade+ crowdsourcing their QA testing and bugfixes to their customers, and so it’s nice to see a little corner of the industry where quality still matters. </p>
<p><strong>09:32 Amnesia Rebirth is annoying and I Quit.</strong></p>
<p>It is very dark, and also your character is an idiot that will grief you. </p>
<p><strong>17:24 Introducing People to VR</strong></p>
<p>The true joy of VR isn’t experiencing it yourself, but in seeing someone else experience it for the first time. </p>
<p><strong>34:23 Half-Life Alyx</strong></p>
<p>It feels like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/234190/Receiver/">Receiver</a> meets Half-Life 2. I dig it.</p>
<p><strong>44:07 VR: Unity Development</strong></p>
<p>This is more fun than the flood of games I’ve got in front of me. We’ll talk more about this later.</p>
<p><strong>45:51 TribeXR DJ School VR</strong></p>
<p>I find playing this game / simulation to be both fun and mildly embarrassing. Like, there’s something childish about walking up to a DJ rack in a public place and just pressing buttons until you figure it out. Of course, the VR setting obviously isn’t <strong>really</strong> a public place with real people, but it looks like a small nightclub or whatever. It feels like someone is going to come storming in any minute and throw me out for messing with the equipment when I obviously have no idea what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>50:16 Watch Dogs Legion</strong></p>
<p>I don’t see people talking about this very much lately, and I’m not sure why. This is the first good Watch Dogs game. That’s gotta be worth talking about, right?</p>
<p><strong>54:35 Mailbag: Doom Maps</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Shamus!</p>
<p>Have you per chance made any Doom levels back in the 90s? I was casually browsing through Doomworld’s Top 100 Most Memorable Doom Maps. In 70th place there is the map called “Doom City”, made in 1995 by Shamus Young. Is there a story to tell?</p>

01:08 Homestar and the Death of Flash

The characters themselves remarked on the death of Flash five years ago. I think Chrome is the only browser that will allow you to see the originals in all of their vector-animated glory.

		<p>Like I said at the end of the show: Pretty soon I’m going to have <a href="http://www.seventh-house.org/about/">Ross</a> on the show and we’re going to talk about Watch Dogs: Legion. The game launches on the 29th of this month, and Ross worked on it. I don’t know if I’m going to have him on the show next week, or the week after. I’m eager to talk about the game, but I also want to make sure I have enough time with the game that I can ask him meaningful questions.</p>
<p>We’ll see how it goes.</p>

<p><span id="more-51037"></span></p>
<p><strong>00:00&nbsp;The State of VR</strong></p>
<p>I’ve studied this stuff quite a bit since this recording, and I have some corrections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issac got the Quest 2, not the original Quest.</li>
<li>The problems with stuttering aren’t a problem with the Oculus Link. It turns out Issac’s computer just isn’t up to the job anymore. Also, if anyone has a suggestion for a sub-$300 CPU+Mobo combo that can offer a reasonable gaming experience, he’d love to hear it.&nbsp; He’s not looking to go full-on PC Master Race, he just wants something that can handle modern games and lightweight VR. (We’re assuming his GPU is good enough for now.)</li>
<li>On the show I said that there weren’t any mid-market VR headsets. Like, it’s just <a href="https://www.oculus.com/quest-2/?locale=en_US">the Quest</a> for $299 and then the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex/">Valve Index</a> for $1,000. But since then I’ve done some more searching and discovered that there ARE mid-market headsets. The only problem is that they’re all from Oculus, and I find their Facebook crap to be pointless and unwelcome in the same way that (say) Uplay is.</li>
<li>I hooked the Quest up to my PC and everything ran fine. There wasn’t any weird DRM locking the headset to one account or any other shenanigans.</li>
<li>On the show I said it feels like another 10° or 15° of field of view would be a massive improvement. I stand by that. It feels like we’re so close to a much better experience, but getting that bump in FOV seems to result in a massive increase in the price of the headset.</li>
</ul>

      <itunes:summary>Like I said at the end of the show: Pretty soon I’m going to have Ross on the show and we’re going to talk about Watch Dogs: Legion. The game launches on the 29th of this month, and Ross worked on it. I don’t know if I’m going to have him on the show next week, or the week after. I’m eager to talk about the game, but I also want to make sure I have enough time with the game that I can ask him meaningful questions.

We’ll see how it goes.

00:00 The State of VR

I’ve studied this stuff quite a bit since this recording, and I have some corrections:


Issac got the Quest 2, not the original Quest.
The problems with stuttering aren’t a problem with the Oculus Link. It turns out Issac’s computer just isn’t up to the job anymore. Also, if anyone has a suggestion for a sub-$300 CPU+Mobo combo that can offer a reasonable gaming experience, he’d love to hear it.  He’s not looking to go full-on PC Master Race, he just wants something that can handle modern games and lightweight VR. (We’re assuming his GPU is good enough for now.)
On the show I said that there weren’t any mid-market VR headsets. Like, it’s just the Quest for $299 and then the Valve Index for $1,000. But since then I’ve done some more searching and discovered that there ARE mid-market headsets. The only problem is that they’re all from Oculus, and I find their Facebook crap to be pointless and unwelcome in the same way that (say) Uplay is.
I hooked the Quest up to my PC and everything ran fine. There wasn’t any weird DRM locking the headset to one account or any other shenanigans.
On the show I said it feels like another 10° or 15° of field of view would be a massive improvement. I stand by that. It feels like we’re so close to a much better experience, but getting that bump in FOV seems to result in a massive increase in the price of the headset.

I’m sure I got a few other details wrong. I keep reading about this stuff, and after three days I STILL feel like I’m in the dark.

Another drawback of a standalone VR headset: I wanted to have a screenshot for this post, but I have no idea how to capture screenshots / footage from an all-in-one device like this. I can capture stuff played over the link cable through Steam, but I have no idea how you’d capture native Oculus stuff.

40:09 Amnesia: Rebirth

Like I said on the show, I’m not feeling this one. I’ve got long-term goals like “survive and get rescued somehow”, but I’m lacking short-term goals like, “Go to the spooky old house to use the phone to call for help” or whatever. I’m only few few hours in, and it hasn’t grabbed me yet. Right now the experience feels more like SOMA and not like Amnesia: The Dark Descent. It’s interesting, but not captivating.

		<p>So once again, my audio is severely over-boosted. It sounds perfect during recording, and then the resulting saved audio sounds like I’m talking through a megaphone. The same thing happened <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=50773">a few episodes ago</a>. Afterward, I went in and balanced all the levels to stop it from happening. And then I was VERY careful to not touch any volume levels. And yet here we are again. </p>
<p>I’ve been doing this show since 2013, and this has never been a problem before. Now for no reason my recording volume is being randomized every week. I can only speculate what sort of nonsense is going on under the hood. The one clue here is that this began happening right after <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=50715">the latest Windows update</a>. I wonder if they added some horrific new “smart” volume system that tries to do your thinking for you. </p>
<p>I guess I need to stop and make a test recording every week, just to make sure I haven’t been sabotaged again. If this was really triggered by a Windows Update, it means this supposedly “helpful” undocumented invisible feature is adding friction and complexity to my workflow. </p>
<p>Oh, and there’s <strong>another</strong> Windows update waiting for me. I’ve been delaying it every time it pops up, but I know it won’t let me do that forever.</p>

<p><strong>00:00 The Irony of my Next Video</strong></p>
<p>I think I’ve decided against pushing to get the video done for tomorrow. I spent most of Sunday polishing it, and made many solid improvements. Like I keep telling the big publishers, “Save time for polish.” Usually a project reaches a point where a little more time will result in a significant improvement in quality, and I think that’s where I am right now.</p>
<p><strong>03:44 Noita V1.0</strong></p>
<p><strong>10:31 Teardown is finally coming out! (But I’m not getting it.)</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I know you’re tired of hearing my whine about my first-world problems. But in case you missed my bellyaching last week: The first 9 months of the year had just two games that I cared about, and now there are FOUR games just in the last two weeks of October.</p>
<p><strong>12:45 Introversion’s Subversion City Generator</strong></p>
<p><strong>14:49 Halloween Decorations</strong></p>
<p>Like I said on the show: When I was a kid, Christmas was the big national cultural event, and Halloween was a distant second. But in the last 20 years it feels like Halloween has made huge strides. I wonder why?</p>
<p>Here is my incredibly American-centric analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maybe this is because of the internet?</strong> It’s easier to share and get people excited for costumes than, say, your Christmas tree. (I dunno. I see lots of Christmas light displays that get a lot of attention.)</li>
<li><strong>Maybe this is because of the shift in the way we think of Halloween?</strong> When I was a kid, both holidays were more or less “for kids”. Christmas has retained its focus on Children, but Halloween seems more able to capture the attention of adults. (Hm. I dunno. SOMEONE is hanging all those dang Christmas lights, and it’s not the kids.)</li>
<li><strong>Maybe this is a reflection of a general shift away from religion?</strong> (Maybe, but Christmas has always enjoyed a great deal of secular appeal.)</li>
<li><strong>Maybe this is a result of simple economics?</strong> Christmas is traditionally much more expensive than Halloween. If you’re looking to “go big” on a holiday, then it’s a lot easier to scale up your Halloween spending than to increase what you already spend on Christmas. Also, the expectation of giving is hard on people with limited income. The stigma against giving cheap gifts is a lot stronger than the shame you’d get from handing out cheap candy or having a lousy costume.</li>
<li><strong>Maybe this is the result of demographics?</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4PM1MFT5mk">Boomers are THE Christmas generation</a>, and most of what we call “Christmas tradition” is stuff we inherited from them. But Boomers aren’t really driving the cultural zeitgeist like they used to, so perhaps this shift is simply the expression of preferences that have always been there, but were drowned out by the values of the baby boomers.</li>
</ul>
<p>(While my family isn’t really big on either holiday<span class="snote" title="1">We don’t go for full-yard displays or big spending.</span>, there was a point in my 30s where my wife and I both came to the conclusion that Christmas is a really weird holiday. Like, doesn’t it feel really strange to bring a tiny pine tree into your house and hang shiny things on it? The Santa mythos is a bit goofy-pants as well. Every Santa Claus movie has a different plot because there isn’t a single strong story to support the character. I have a few additional criticisms of the holiday from a religious standpoint, but I really don’t want to offend anyone or make people feel like I’m judging them, their parenting, or their love of the holiday. I’m just saying it’s not for me. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to celebrate, we just like to keep it low-key.)</p>
<p>So, how does the Halloween vs. Christmas thing stack up in your part of the world?</p>
<p><strong>29:09 Forced to use UbiStore</strong></p>
<p>If nothing else, buying Watch Dogs Legion from Ubisoft’s pathetic late-90s digital storefront should yield at least one good rant.</p>
<p><strong>34:57 Mailbag: First PC Build?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast</p>
<p>My beloved decade-old laptop has finally given up the ghost and I figured it was high time to build my first pc. It went much smoother than I thought it would as someone who isn’t particularly tech savvy. The only problems I encounter was with installing Windows 10. The problems I encounter with it are too numerous to list here but it basically came down to it making me reinstall windows everytime I booted up my computer. What did you find hardest, most frustrating or most surprising the first time you built a pc and what were the specs?</p>
<p>Sincerely, Ty</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=18607">Here</a> is the machine I talked about on the show.</p>
<p><strong>41:26 Mailbag: Half-Life: Alyx</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Now that there’s been some distance between the release of Half-Life: Alyx and a promised revitalization of the franchise, I’m curious if you had any thoughts on the potential narrative directions the series could take, and if the developments in HLA met your approval or critique. I know Shamus’ love of the Half-Life series is well documented at this point, but I don’t recall hearing any takes from Paul. His input is nonetheless appreciated if he has any. Hell, maybe reach out and get a quote from Soldierhawk too, if she’s available!</p>
<p>Like Shamus, I am both: 1) A massive fan of all things Half-Life, and 2) Lacking a VR setup. Setting aside the cost, I couldn’t justify the purchase of a headset since I was unsure how much mileage I’d be able to get out of it without an expansive and varied game library. The announcement of HLA left me fighting myself real hard on whether or not to dump a few hundred bucks on a Vive just to play that game, but I think I made the right choice in the end. Since I couldn’t play the game, but refused to torture myself with avoiding spoilers in the long-term, I went ahead and watched a compilation of all the cutscenes, dialogue, and narrative beats of the game. This is an admittedly incomplete experience that skips over all the moment-to-moment gameplay sections, but I trust it’s sufficient enough if we’re just evaluating the story, and nothing major is being lost in a truncated highlight video.</p>
<p>For reference, this was the video I watched: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57NPnGvhzvE</p>
<p>[Redacted spoilers]</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Dtec (dee-tek)</p></blockquote>

Dear Diecast
Microsoft is launching xCloud…
It seems like a lot of people with money believe in this idea. Thinking back over your past discussions of streaming gaming I don’t remember much regarding how it competes with consoles.
What if the console generation after the one about to land is a $50 box and a $10 a month subscription instead of a $500 box?
For the consumer it removes the sticker shock and the upgrade cycle and it takes nearly 4 years for it to become more expensive.
For Microsoft it will be more profitable because the servers to run all these games are going to be cheaper than all those Xbox’s would’ve been. (The utilization is higher, you don’t need the pretty boxes and you can use industrial power and cooling solutions.)
So is that the end game?

<p>The classic problem when designing 3D models for first-person experiences:</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ve measured a real-world couch, and I’ve built this 3D couch to match. Oh, but this couch makes the coffee table look like a toy. So I’ll make that bigger. Oh, but now the TV looks tiny. I can make that bigger, but now the room is way too crowded and the floor lamp is sticking inside the couch. So let me spread all these things out a little. Oh wait, I need to make the room bigger. Ugh. Now the front window looks wrong. If I fix that, then the front door will look weird.”</p>
<p>An hour later your boss comes in and demands to know why you built a furnished airplane hangar and he also wants to know why you’re currently measuring your trash can and suddenly you notice he looks much too large for the room and the printer looks too small and your cubicle is the size of a phone booth and you’ve lost all ability to perceive distance or proportion at any scale.</p>
<p>Or maybe that was just me.</p>

You can see my Favorite Keyboard Ever in the photos below.

08:26 Exapunks




11:25 New Chair

This is roughly what you’d see with your human eyes if you came into my office:



However, it’s a bit hard to see what’s going on here, so let me open the curtain so the camera can make sense of this:




I realize these kinds of chairs are SUPER-common these days, but this is my first and I’m really happy with it.

15:17 Oxygen Not Included

Sounds like I should revisit this one.

18:31 The Most Unappealing Preview Ever.




An expositional cutscene with no tension, followed by an introduction of some super-boring enemies, followed by yawn-inducing combat demo where the player spams overpowered spells rather than engaging with the combat mechanics, followed by a huge quicktime event.

It has overwhelming thumbs up on YouTube. Sigh. This is why we never have nice things.

<span id="more-50695"></span></p>
<p><strong>00:00 “Kingdom Come: Deliverance” “unavailable” on Epic</strong></p>
<p>The problem seems to be sorted out now, but that was strange. Also, after we finished the recording I opened up EGS and realized I also own (and have also never played) KC:D. </p>
<p><strong>04:41 Cleanroom Cabletracks</strong></p>
<p><strong>13:30 “Login from New Location” and 2FA</strong></p>
<p>I get that Two Factor Authentication makes a system more secure, but for me it’s never worth the risk. Just use a long, varied, and unique password. That protects against the vast majority of attacks. Once you’re using a password manager, additional password complexity is free. You can copy &amp; paste a 25 character password as easily as a 6 character one. A password that long is basically hack-proof. Not only would it require insane amounts of computer power to brute force, but your garden-variety account thief isn’t going to invest that much time and computing power into a single password. An account thief is a shoplifter looking for easy targets, not a cat burglar looking to tackle enormous security systems.</p>
<p>Now, there’s still the risk that a hacker might get some sort of malware onto your machine that could steal your password when you enter it on the login page. But that risk is very, very small. 2FA protects against this rare and exotic form of attack, and in exchange you run the risk that the company itself will either sell or accidentally expose your phone number. At that point you’ll be buried in infuriating spam calls forever. </p>
<p>Worse, a compromised phone number is a worse problem than a hacked account. Yeah, it would be annoying to lose access to my Blizzard account, but you can usually recover the account by proving you’re the person who’s been paying the bill. It might take some time, but you can regain control and change the password. </p>
<p>But what do you do when your phone number is hounded by spam calls day and night? There’s no fixing that, short of changing your number.</p>
<p><strong>18:39 Mailbag: Bloodlines 2 delays and problems.</strong></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<blockquote><p>Hello Shamus, Hello Paul</p>
<p>Yesterday I’ve seen Yong Yeas video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xd-nvCKbuKo) on the rescent events in the development of Bloodlines 2. Long story short:<br>
Publisher and Developer pushed the release of the 5 year in development game to 2021 for QA reasons (me: Yes!) and fired the the two main writers and driving forces behind Bloodlines 2 (me: WTFF?F!) – and Bloodlines 1 – to replace them with one 20 years of Ubisoft dude (me: §$#+&amp;Ø%!!!). The very, very commited main writer came out of the blue with the firing and the delay while most of the work was already finished and the rest will finish in the promised 2020 timeline.</p>
<p>The end of the year blog post showed that many of your readers anticipate this game, but YouTube isn’t a good place for disussions. So what are your (and your readers) thoughts on this topic? What harm can this one ubi-dude do to the mostly finished product within 6 to 12 months?</p>
<p>All the best</p>
<p>Lars</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>24:24 Mailbag: Steam Controller</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>The YouTube algorithm did something good and recommended me a retrospective on the Steam Controller[1]. The thing I found most interesting is that apparently, gyro aiming is nearly as precise as mouse aiming[2]. As of now, only the Steam, Switch and Playstation controllers contain gyroscopes and there are no plans to add them for Xbox, so many developers don’t bother.</p>
<p>Since the Steam Controller flopped pretty badly, how do you think controllers might evolve in the future? Do you think that there will ever be a huge push to bring more accuracy to game controllers?</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
RFS-81</p>
<p>[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dsL1wgu2e8<br>
[2] I’m hiding the tl;dr portion of my mail in a footnote to make it easier to truncate for the show. I actually have a Steam Controller but turned off the gyros because I thought accidentally jostling the camera would be annoying. In Zelda on the Switch, it’s only turned on while you’re using a bow, so I gave it a chance and found that it worked pretty well for me. Use the stick to face in the right direction and tilt the controller to line up a shot.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>30:40 Mailbag: Streets of Rage 4</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>This one is for Shamus. I don’t know if 2D beat-em-ups are your thing, so I was wondering whether Streets of Rage 4 is on your radar, because I think it might be up your alley.</p>
<p>It is perfectible, it does the Arkham Asylum thing where it tracks how much damage you deal without getting hit, it has tons of difficulty options, it has electronic music and a strong art style. Most importantly, judo-throwing enemies into one another is extremely satisfying.</p>
<p>So yeah, basically I just wanted to shill for a game I like.</p>

<p><strong>35:57 Mailbag: Brown Shooters</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi!</p>
<p>We all know that there’s a tendency to make fun of grey/brown shooters (often of military nature). But in more serious note, is there a some artistic merit in going with this aesthetic? May be any of you have an example of a game of this aesthetic, that you like?</p>
<p>Best regards, DeadlyDark</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>39:57 Mailbag: Games that Changed for the Better</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Casters of Die!</p>
<p>With the recent release of Project Cars 3, once again a to me beloved franchise got changed in big way to attract a larger audience, but lost what made it special in the process.<br>
Now there are numerous examples where that happens (Mass Effect 1 to 2, Fallout 2 to 3, Rainbow Six 3 to Lockdown, Ghost Recon to Advanced Warfighter, Need for Speed Porsche to Underground, to name a few).</p>
<p>Now it seems like I always fall under the category of “fan until the franchise us spoiled”, and I never encountered a franchise that did not interest me until a sequel came along that fundamentally changed it, that make me suddenly like it.</p>
<p>So, did it ever happen to you guys that a game franchise that was initially not for you changed to suddenly cater to your tastes and sensibilities?</p>
<p>And I know some of those changes we’re rewarded with bigger success, but I assume that a new franchise without both the baggage and alienation of old fans would have been even more successful. Am I undervaluing name recognition or is that another example of executives and marketing not really understanding the medium?</p>
<p>Regards from Austria,<br>

<p><strong>46:35 Mailbag: Mass Effect Remaster</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Paul Shepard and Shamus Vakarian,</p>
<p>The Internet (TM) is brimming with rumors about a Mass Effect Trilogy Remaster. What are your thoughts? Are you also looking forward to BioWare’s inevitable attempts to patch up their clumsy retcons by putting Javik’s face on all the Prothean statues on Ilos?</p>
<p>Stay safe,<br>
Mako</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s supposedly just a graphics remaster so I can’t imagine how EA / BioWare is going to disappoint me this time, but I shouldn’t underestimate them. </p>
<p><strong>50:08 Mailbag: Rubberband AI</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear diecast,</p>
<p>What do you think of rubberbanding (AI growing stronger/weaker depending on your performance)? Some people say it’s good because it means the game is always challenging you while at the same time not throwing up any insurmountable challenges. I however don’t like it since it feels that whatever i do, i will always barely win. So why try to play at 100% when 80% will do?</p>
<p>With kind regards,<br>
Chris</p></blockquote>

00:00 “Kingdom Come: Deliverance” “unavailable” on Epic

The problem seems to be sorted out now, but that was strange. Also, after we finished the recording I opened up EGS and realized I also own (and have also never played) KC:D. 

04:41 Cleanroom Cabletracks

13:30 “Login from New Location” and 2FA

I get that Two Factor Authentication makes a system more secure, but for me it’s never worth the risk. Just use a long, varied, and unique password. That protects against the vast majority of attacks. Once you’re using a password manager, additional password complexity is free. You can copy &amp; paste a 25 character password as easily as a 6 character one. A password that long is basically hack-proof. Not only would it require insane amounts of computer power to brute force, but your garden-variety account thief isn’t going to invest that much time and computing power into a single password. An account thief is a shoplifter looking for easy targets, not a cat burglar looking to tackle enormous security systems.

Now, there’s still the risk that a hacker might get some sort of malware onto your machine that could steal your password when you enter it on the login page. But that risk is very, very small. 2FA protects against this rare and exotic form of attack, and in exchange you run the risk that the company itself will either sell or accidentally expose your phone number. At that point you’ll be buried in infuriating spam calls forever. 

Worse, a compromised phone number is a worse problem than a hacked account. Yeah, it would be annoying to lose access to my Blizzard account, but you can usually recover the account by proving you’re the person who’s been paying the bill. It might take some time, but you can regain control and change the password. 

But what do you do when your phone number is hounded by spam calls day and night? There’s no fixing that, short of changing your number.

18:39 Mailbag: Bloodlines 2 delays and problems.




Hello Shamus, Hello Paul
Yesterday I’ve seen Yong Yeas video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xd-nvCKbuKo) on the rescent events in the development of Bloodlines 2. Long story short:
Publisher and Developer pushed the release of the 5 year in development game to 2021 for QA reasons (me: Yes!) and fired the the two main writers and driving forces behind Bloodlines 2 (me: WTFF?F!) – and Bloodlines 1 – to replace them with one 20 years of Ubisoft dude (me: §$#+&amp;Ø%!!!). The very, very commited main writer came out of the blue with the firing and the delay while most of the work was already finished and the rest will finish in the promised 2020 timeline.
The end of the year blog post showed that many of your readers anticipate this game, but YouTube isn’t a good place for disussions. So what are your (and your readers) thoughts on this topic? What harm can this one ubi-dude do to the mostly finished product within 6 to 12 months?
All the best

24:24 Mailbag: Steam Controller

Dear Diecast,
The YouTube algorithm did something good and recommended me a retrospective on the Steam Controller[1]. The thing I found most interesting is that apparently, gyro aiming is nearly as precise as mouse aiming[2]. As of now, only the Steam, Switch and Playstation controllers contain gyroscopes and there are no plans to add them for Xbox, so many developers don’t bother.
Since the Steam Controller flopped pretty badly, how do you think controllers might evolve in the future? Do you think that there will ever be a huge push to bring more accuracy to game controllers?
Regards,

<p><strong>57:02 Mailbag: Time and Space in Games</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Servus, Würfelwerfer (pronounciation guide: servoos wir-fell ware-fer)</p>
<p>Something I wondered about for a long time, but it resurfaced recently due to Microsoft Flight Simulation 2020: the perception of time is greatly altered in video games, at least for me personally. To elaborate: Playing the Cessna Flight school, you have to navigate two waypoints, the shortest taking about 5 minutes. Now, in real life, five minutes are over very quickly. My commute is 6 minutes by bike and that’s so short I don’t even bother with taking my headpphones out of my pocket, because I have to turn off any aural distraction in such short a time. In game though, those 5 Minutes felt eternal, despite me actually having fun.</p>
<p>Is that the reason many open world games are actually quite condensed in their size, yet still feel big? I had a similar occurance when Playing Skyrim in VR: while playing “pancake” (as in, on an ordinary screen), Skyrim feels like a huge place with impressive mountain ranges throned over by the throat of the world that looms over the land in the distance from Whiterun. In VR however, seeing everything “in scale”, it turns out the TotW is a couple of hundred meters high, strangely steep hill that starts right outside of the town walls of Whiterun.</p>
<p>I think especially the latter might have to do with being watched through a fish eyed field of view through a monitor, but why does time feel so different? Are those phenomena linked, or different?</p>
<p>Kind Regards from Austria (the mountany place in Europe, NOT the upside down place)<br>

<p><strong>00:52 Soulworker</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/630100/SoulWorker__Anime_Action_MMO/">This game has been out for two and a half years</a>, and I’ve never seen it before. I even went <strong>looking</strong> for an MMO a few weeks ago and I somehow didn’t encounter this one.</p>
<p>I complained about the writing. Maybe I should provide a sample. This quote isn’t verbatim, but it’s very close and I promise it’s not worse than what’s in the game:</p>
<blockquote><p>There was once a man who could fight stronger than anyone else in the world, but he could never find rest.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sorry I didn’t grab an exact quote. I didn’t get any footage or screenshots while I was playing. I honestly expected to bound off the game after an hour or so, but then it ate most of Saturday. </p>
<p>I see little snippets of text like the sample above while furiously clicking past the nonsense the NPCs are spewing. In light of this, I want to thank the developers for two features: </p>
<ol>
<li>The non-localized vocals, meaning I can’t understand anything the NPCs are saying and so the bad writing is undetectable as long as I don’t do anything foolish like read the text.</li>
<li>The “Skip dialog” button, which makes it easier to not read things.</li>
</ol>
<p>The game is very flashy, grindy, and not particularly challenging. This probably isn’t a game you’ll play for months on end, but it makes a good distraction game to keep your hands busy while your brain is elsewhere.</p>
<p>I had enough fun that I thought I should kick a few bucks to the developers. I went to the cash shop, but then I realized I didn’t really want or need anything. I wasn’t interested in any of the doll clothes, and I was already more than powerful enough to handle all the content in front of me.</p>
<p>If only they had robot suits. I’d pay for some robot suits!</p>
<p><strong>09:37 Visual Studio: “Community” Edition</strong></p>
<p>Fun fact: Whenever I type “Visual Studio”, there’s about an 80% chance that I’ll type “Visual Stupid” instead. I worry this means I type the word “stupid” too often and my muscle memory is just leading me down the most familiar path.</p>
<p>Or maybe I’m just really studio.</p>
<p><strong>25:35 Horizon vs. Flight Sim</strong></p>
<p>On one hand, I’m always wary of Microsoft’s video game offerings. On the other hand, this is a quasi-procgen world that uses real-world maps and machine learning to generate the cities. I can’t skip something like that.</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>32:52 Mailbag: Software Disenchantment</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>I recently read <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/">an article about Software Disenchantment</a>, the feeling of disillusionment when you realize that despite systems getting vastly more powerful, software doesn’t run vastly faster.</p>
<p>I’m not very up to date with my gaming, but I haven’t really noticed the same problem in games. Aside from install sizes ballooning out of proportion they seem to run fine with ever more impressive tech.</p>
<p>Have you guys noticed games getting slower and bloated as systems improve?</p>
<p>Vale,</p>
<p>-Tim</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>49:03 Mailbag: Punishment and Fire Emblem</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Shamus and Paul,</p>
<p>I don’t think you’ve ever played Fire Emblem that I know of, but after the Dark Souls punishment ask last week I thought it would be interesting to hear you consider how they handle punishment.</p>
<p>Fire Emblem is sort of like Xcom, where you have a set of units that die permanently, but unlike Xcom they all have unique designs and personalities, and there are a lot fewer of them (generally around 20-40 for the whole game, each joining at some point throughout the game). The end result is that in normal “good” play, you will want to reset the map when you lose a unit.</p>
<p>But every time a character dies, you have a dynamic choice. Is it someone you cared about? Probably want to reset. Your crutch unit who’s carried the last few maps? Same thing.</p>
<p>But maybe you’re at the end of a really challenging stage, and you just want to be done. Someone died, but you can probably move on without them. Most of the time, there are “replacement” crutch units who join at a usable power level later in the game and can help your team if it isn’t up to snuff, but they are generally weaker than fully trained player units from early in the game (since characters level up like a JRPG). The choice is yours whether to reset the map, and depending on the circumstances, it can be a very gruelling choice.</p>
<p>The upshot of this punishment system is that it leaves a lot of agency in the player’s hands as far as how punished they are for a given mistake. And it means that every time you “let” a character die, you really do feel responsible, since ultimately you decided that they weren’t worth going back for. When you beat the game, every character gets a little epilogue telling you what they did after the war, but the ones you let die simply say something like “Perished in Chapter 18”, which can be a huge gutpunch, potentially, and can definitely motivate you to play better on a future playthrough.</p>
<p>What do you think of this dynamic, player-driven punishment approach? How do you think it could apply to other genres?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>56:22 Mailbag: Retcons</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast</p>
<p>First off, I’d like to thank you for the Fallout recommendation a few months ago. I have been thoroughly enjoying the game repeatedly since. Though I do like New Vegas more.</p>
<p>One of the most surprising things to me while playing Fallout was the lack of vault experiments. Vault Tec definitely isn’t painted as a saint in the game, but they are far from the mustache twirling evil Umbrella like entity in later games.</p>
<p>On one hand, this makes them more relatable and real. Cutting corners and ignoring concerns to help their bottom line at the cost of human lives are things shady corporations do. On the other hand, the vaults in later games are some of my favorite parts of the series, but there is no logical reason to clone a bunch of Gary’s, lock recovering addicts in a vault filled with drugs or force people to elect an overseer to be killed repeatedly. I wonder – are the vault experiments new to the Bethesda games or were they introduced in Fallout 2?</p>
<p>Either way, it got me thinking about retcons. Outside of comics which have them every few years, the only other major retcon I can think of off the top of my head is Riddles in the Dark.

<p><strong>1:05:25 Mailbag: EPUB Mass Effect</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hey Shamus,</p>
<p>This isn’t a Diecast question (feel free to include it however), but I couldn’t find any other means of contact.</p>
<p>I recently decided to convert your Mass Effect Retrospective series into an EPUB ebook, so that I can on-the-move indulge in my petty bitterness over a 8 year old game’s narrative failures. I have converted the first two chapters (see here:  https://github.com/namandixit/mass-effect-retrospective, the file `book.epub` is the one), and was wondering whether it would be okay for me to leave this in public. If not, I can make this repo private, and not let anyone else share into my ritualistic masochistic resentment —  over a story about writers’ personal sexual fantasies fawning over a hero, a bloody icon.</p>
<p>Take care,<br>
Naman Dixit</p></blockquote>

      <itunes:summary>Heads up: I’m finally getting back to video production after the move disrupted everything. I had a video on the Epic Games Store that was ready for editing, but then Epic did something really lame and stupid. I thought it would feel really odd to have a video about Epic that somehow didn’t mention these current events, so the video went back in the over for another week. 

I’m not sure what I can scrape together in time for tomorrow. If we don’t get a Tuesday column, can I just blame Tim Sweeney?

Show notes:

00:52 Soulworker

This game has been out for two and a half years, and I’ve never seen it before. I even went looking for an MMO a few weeks ago and I somehow didn’t encounter this one.

I complained about the writing. Maybe I should provide a sample. This quote isn’t verbatim, but it’s very close and I promise it’s not worse than what’s in the game:

There was once a man who could fight stronger than anyone else in the world, but he could never find rest.
Sorry I didn’t grab an exact quote. I didn’t get any footage or screenshots while I was playing. I honestly expected to bound off the game after an hour or so, but then it ate most of Saturday. 

I see little snippets of text like the sample above while furiously clicking past the nonsense the NPCs are spewing. In light of this, I want to thank the developers for two features: 


The non-localized vocals, meaning I can’t understand anything the NPCs are saying and so the bad writing is undetectable as long as I don’t do anything foolish like read the text.
The “Skip dialog” button, which makes it easier to not read things.

The game is very flashy, grindy, and not particularly challenging. This probably isn’t a game you’ll play for months on end, but it makes a good distraction game to keep your hands busy while your brain is elsewhere.

I had enough fun that I thought I should kick a few bucks to the developers. I went to the cash shop, but then I realized I didn’t really want or need anything. I wasn’t interested in any of the doll clothes, and I was already more than powerful enough to handle all the content in front of me.

If only they had robot suits. I’d pay for some robot suits!

09:37 Visual Studio: “Community” Edition

Fun fact: Whenever I type “Visual Studio”, there’s about an 80% chance that I’ll type “Visual Stupid” instead. I worry this means I type the word “stupid” too often and my muscle memory is just leading me down the most familiar path.

Or maybe I’m just really studio.

25:35 Horizon vs. Flight Sim

On one hand, I’m always wary of Microsoft’s video game offerings. On the other hand, this is a quasi-procgen world that uses real-world maps and machine learning to generate the cities. I can’t skip something like that.




32:52 Mailbag: Software Disenchantment

Dear Diecast,
I recently read an article about Software Disenchantment, the feeling of disillusionment when you realize that despite systems getting vastly more powerful, software doesn’t run vastly faster.
I’m not very up to date with my gaming, but I haven’t really noticed the same problem in games. Aside from install sizes ballooning out of proportion they seem to run fine with ever more impressive tech.
Have you guys noticed games getting slower and bloated as systems improve?
Vale,
-Tim
49:03 Mailbag: Punishment and Fire Emblem

Hi Shamus and Paul,
I don’t think you’ve ever played Fire Emblem that I know of, but after the Dark Souls punishment ask last week I thought it would be interesting to hear you consider how they handle punishment.
Fire Emblem is sort of like Xcom, where you have a set of units that die permanently, but unlike Xcom they all have unique designs and personalities, and there are a lot fewer of them (generally around 20-40 for the whole game, each joining at some point throughout the game). The end result is that in normal “good” play, you will want to reset the map when you lose a unit.
But e…</itunes:summary>

<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>A lot of discussion has been had on the blog about disincentives for defeat in video games. The typical method is the loss of time. The boss kills you in Dark Souls, so you have to spend ten minutes fighting your way back to it. Or, less directly — you fall into the lava and lose all your gear in Minecraft, so you have to redo all the work you did to acquire it.</p>
<p>This is suboptimal in various ways, depending on the execution, but games do it because there are few other options. However, if in the future technology is developed that allows for a much more direct interface between computer and brain, another form of disincentive presents itself: physical pain.</p>
<p>The boss kills you in Dark Souls, and the computer stimulates your pain sensors so it feels like you’ve been punched in the face. But then it stops, and you reload a save from right at the beginning of the encounter. Very little time has been wasted, but you still have a pretty good reason not to let the boss kill you again.</p>
<p>Obviously, keeping this technology safe and out of the hands of bad actors would be a…challenge. But assuming that could be managed, what do you think of the implications of this for game design? Would you be more or less likely to play Dark Souls: Punch in the Face Edition?</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi Shamus and Paul,</p>
<p>Glad you’re both moving through the recent bumps in the road! I was wondering what your thoughts on PC hardware are going through into the next generation of consoles. Shamus’ PC was basically god-tier level (IIRC) when he got it but the upcoming hardware (both on PC and in the Xbox Series X) looks like it’s going to blow even that out of the water. Do you think there will be a huge divide between those who have ray-tracing “on” and those who have it “off”? Does supporting those different rendering techniques and vastly different hardware performance levels effectively double the work for developers? </p>
<p>It seems like a nightmare just as we were getting out of the limitations of the current generation of hardware: I was expecting big, open, highly detailed worlds but it seems like putting in ray-tracing (while a really cool and probably end-point rendering technology) we’re going to be limited in the types of spaces that can be made when those effects are implemented because it’ll just be too taxing…</p>

<p>So I’ve finished Black Mesa earlier this year, and I’ve noticed one thing about it.

00:00 Intro / Video editor

For the curious, the free video editor I talked about in this segment is Davinci Resolve.

03:00 Eastshade




24:54 Red Dead Redemption 2

Neither of us said so, but we both talk about how upsetting Grand Theft Auto V can be. I’m betting we were both talking about this bit.

30:40 Beyond Blue

I don’t know if I’d find this game fan, but it LOOKS amazing.




36:14 Mailbag: Characters!

Dear Shamus and Soldierhawke,
The recent release of Beyond a Steel Sky – a sequel 26 years in the making – has got me wondering if either of you are partial to the adventure game. For me the best thing about the genre is the characters: over the years I’ve really treasured getting to ‘meet’ the likes of George Stobbart and Nico Collard, Phoenix Wright and Maya Fey, and of course Guybrush Threepwood and Elaine Marley. So my two part question is firstly to wonder whether you have any favourites you’d like to discuss, and more broadly, how important you think good characters are to a game and whether you think the industry is getting it right at the moment.

46:41 Mailbag: Black Mesa

Hi!
So I’ve finished Black Mesa earlier this year, and I’ve noticed one thing about it. It’s a great expansion on the original ideas, and in some ways switched the closer to original Unreal, instead of Half-Life. But one thing that stood up, is that almost every challenge or puzzle was repeated three times in increasing difficulty. I don’t mind usage of the rule of three, but its repeated usage started to seem very artificial. So I wonder, if any of you noticed it, and what alternatives to the rule of three you can think of?

Dear Diecast-caster-ers,
(This is primarily for SoldierHawke, unless Shamus has played Eastshade by now.) When I played Eastshade last year, I felt like a good term to describe it would be “unevenly developed”. What one thing would you most like to have seen developed further, either in the game or in a hypothetical sequel? Or conversely, what underdeveloped thing should’ve been scrapped? This could be mechanically or story related.
As an example, on my part, I feel like the unique tea that lets you see hidden objects, but was only used in a single quest, was underused and could’ve been dropped without much loss.

00:00 No Man’s Sky is still a disaster

Whelp, that didn’t work out. I guess I’ll come back in 2021 and see if things are any better.

Someone out there really needs to make a non-broken, non-horrible version of this game.

09:22 LOTRO

It sounds like Paul is still having fun? 

12:35 Hue

This game came out in 2016, but I’m just discovering it now. It’s a lot more interesting than I would have guessed based on the premise.




19:26 Townscaper

As others have done, Paul decided to make some tools in Python to edit the save files of Townscaper. You can have a look at his code if you like.




41:28 Circuit boards

Is this the new language that everything will be written in ten years down the line, or is it merely a passing fad? Is it worth spending a little time learning it out of curiosity like I’m considering (perhaps simply for the mental benefits of knowing multiple languages, even if I never use it professionally)?</p>

<p><strong>00:00 Happy Fireworks day!</strong></p>
<p>Okay, it was 4th of July when we recorded this. I’m pretty sure it’s over now.</p>
<p><strong>06:32 Paul got a job!</strong></p>
<p>Congrats!</p>
<p><strong>10:26 Loot Box Ban</strong></p>
<p>Well <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Kotick">Bobby</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wilson">Drew</a>… I don’t know what you clowns thought was going to happen, but the thing *I* thought was going to happen, happened: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/uk-parliament-ban-all-loot-boxes-until-evidence-proves-theyre-safe-for-kids/">UK Parliament: Ban all loot boxes until evidence proves they’re safe for kids</a>.</p>
<p>You could have kept your little gambling parlors running quietly off to one side as optional game modes where nobody noticed or cared. You could have continued to exploit people with a weakness for gambling as much as you wanted. But instead you designed entire games around this reprehensible business model, pissed off your customers, and then rubbed it in everyone’s faces. So now we get this.</p>
<p>Congratulations, idiots. Have fun explaining this one to shareholders.</p>
<p><strong>21:17 Worms Armageddon</strong></p>
<p>For those of you too young to remember, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BorZc59aqAg">this</a> is the game we’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>24:55 Microsoft got bored with MIXER and left it outside in the rain.</strong></p>
<p>It’s only been a few months since <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dbloom/2019/08/01/twitchs-biggest-star-ninja-joins-microsofts-mixer-in-exclusive-programming-deal/#1dac8f58d6f6">Microsoft paid Ninja a (rumored) $30 million to join their streaming platform</a>, and now they’re shutting down the platform. Man, I’d hate to be a Microsoft engineer that just spent 4 years of my life building the infrastructure for this streaming platform, only to have it closed like that. I’d feel sorry for Ninja too, but that dude got <del datetime="2020-07-06T12:53:27+00:00">seven</del> eight figures so I figure he’ll pull through somehow.</p>
<p><strong>36:09 Black Desert Online Remastered</strong></p>
<p>You may remember what I said about this game <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=42433">back in 2018</a>. During this segment, I claimed that “nothing has changed”. That’s not exactly true. There are some changes beyond the addition of shinier pixels:</p>
<p>The early game has been truncated. The entire starting town is now abandoned and players begin the game in the second quest hub, with the leveling scaled so that you breeze through the first 7 levels in the space of a couple of minutes. Not sure why that was done, but I guess it doesn’t harm anything. The story is incomprehensible dross anyway, so throwing a tiny bit of it away isn’t a bad thing. I suspect this was done to speed things up because they’re in a hurry to get players to the level cap where they can be milked for pay-to-win PvP bullshit.</p>
<p>The inventory space restrictions have been greatly relaxed. You start the game with 40 inventory slots instead of (IIRC) 15 or 20. Again, they’re taking the focus off the early game and pushing players towards the more lucrative endgame.</p>
<p>The game is even more absurd with in-game money than before. My character was a multimillionaire before they hit level 10. Peasants casually hand out gold bars for performing mundane tasks. Of course, nothing you really want can be purchased with the in-game money, because the developers want you to buy those things with your <strong>actual</strong> money. </p>
<p>The game now installs <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/582660/announcements/detail/1319965970611901682">XIGNCODE3 anti-cheat on your PC</a> without asking or even telling you, and the program remains running even when BDO isn’t running<span class="snote" title="1">I un-installed the game as soon as I discovered this. It LOOKS like XIGNCODE is also uninstalled, but I’ve read reports from people who claim it sticks around.</span>. </p>
<p>That’s it. The interface and dialog are still horribly translated, you still level too fast to enjoy the combat, which is the only system in the game that works. The game is still focused on creating inconveniences for the player and then renting them the outrageously overpriced solution at the needlessly convoluted cash shop. And even if you muddle through all of that, the game just dumps you into PvP – willing or not – at the end of your journey. I would love it if I could just pay $15 a month and play a version of this game with the ugliness and artificial hassles removed. But it would probably cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 a month to buy all of the features we take for granted in most online games<span class="snote" title="2">Like the ability to summon your mount at will. They actually rent that to you on a per-month, per-character basis! That’s like renting me auto-run! COME ON.</span>. And even then, it’s still a game where you buy things (or get them for “free”) instead of earning them through gameplay.</p>
<p>When people complain about a game being ruined by MTX, this is exactly what they’re talking about. This is a gorgeous game with solid gameplay. This could be an MMO for the ages. But instead it’s a sad and frustrating little also-ran, because the in-game progression was broken by the desire to drive people to the cash shop.</p>
<p>What a horrible waste.</p>
<p><strong>42:48 Mailbag: Eastshade</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>I’ve been working on my Steam backlog recently and just downloaded Eastshade to give it a try, and when I was installing it I noticed that Shamus also has it.  I don’t know about Paul, he’s not on my Steam friends list.  Anyway, I was wondering if Shamus has had any time to play it.  I’ve only played a few hours so far, but I’m finding it really beautiful and relaxing, with cute little RPG elements that make it pretty fun for a game with no combat that is about wandering around and painting things.  In my mind it doesn’t really qualify as a “walking simulator” because there are actual gameplay elements and things for you to do.  It’s nice to see something that might reasonably qualify as an RPG that doesn’t rely on murdering tons of dudes.</p>

<p><strong>53:04 Mailbag: Non-Paradox 4X</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hey Shamus and Paul,</p>
<p>Chris,(Gautsu here) I hope you are both doing okay! Anyways, I didn’t want to hijack or divert your Civ threads comments. What are yours and everyone else thoughts on non-Civ, non Paradox 4x games? I know that some people consider Alpha Centauri a Civ game due to its pedigree and some don’t because of the lack of Civilization in the title, but it is my absolute favorite. How are other games viewed though? Endless Legend seems cool as hell but I have never been able to commit enough time to complete a whole play through. Does anyone have an opinion on Gladius, the 40k 4x, or Sorceror Kings, Age of Wonders (Fantasy or Planetfall), or Fallen Enchantress? Honestly curious,<br>
Thanks,<br>
Chris</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>1:00:22 Mailbag: Virtual Tabletop</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Deeeeear Diecast,</p>
<p>You have long been an enthusiast of tabletop role-playing games, to the point of naming your blog after the hobby. You have been a DM for D&amp;D in the past, but I’ve never heard of you using any digital platforms for playing RPGs. What do you think about virtual tabletop systems, such as Fantasy Grounds or Roll20?</p>
<p>Part of the reason for asking is the fact that I am working on a Kickstarter for a similar platform (<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/criticalzero/crtitical-zero/description">Critical Zero</a>). I wanted to know if you use such systems &amp; why. What do you like about virtual tabletops? What features do you find lacking, as a GM &amp;/or as a player? If you don’t use any, what might change your mind &amp; convince you to try one?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p><strong>1:13:10 Mailbag: GPU Scheduling</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi, team DieCast!</p>
<p>Apparently, in recent weeks, Microsoft released new feature of hardware accelerated GPU scheduling for Win10 (https://www.minitool.com/news/win10-v2004-hardware-accelerated-gpu-scheduling.html). So what’s your opinion on  this change, and how’d you estimate the amount of performance gains achieved by this change?</p>
<p>Best regards, DeadlyDark</p>
<p>P.S. Erm. Correction. It’s not released yet, I’ve misread the date</p></blockquote>

      <itunes:summary>Somehow, Paul had fireworks going off in the background, pretty much through the entire show. The reason you don’t hear any fireworks on my side is that I’m 3 hours ahead of Paul and the people here had already run out by the time the show started.

00:00 Happy Fireworks day!

Okay, it was 4th of July when we recorded this. I’m pretty sure it’s over now.

06:32 Paul got a job!

Congrats!

10:26 Loot Box Ban

Well Bobby, Drew… I don’t know what you clowns thought was going to happen, but the thing *I* thought was going to happen, happened: UK Parliament: Ban all loot boxes until evidence proves they’re safe for kids.

You could have kept your little gambling parlors running quietly off to one side as optional game modes where nobody noticed or cared. You could have continued to exploit people with a weakness for gambling as much as you wanted. But instead you designed entire games around this reprehensible business model, pissed off your customers, and then rubbed it in everyone’s faces. So now we get this.

Congratulations, idiots. Have fun explaining this one to shareholders.

21:17 Worms Armageddon

For those of you too young to remember, this is the game we’re talking about.

24:55 Microsoft got bored with MIXER and left it outside in the rain.

It’s only been a few months since Microsoft paid Ninja a (rumored) $30 million to join their streaming platform, and now they’re shutting down the platform. Man, I’d hate to be a Microsoft engineer that just spent 4 years of my life building the infrastructure for this streaming platform, only to have it closed like that. I’d feel sorry for Ninja too, but that dude got seven eight figures so I figure he’ll pull through somehow.

36:09 Black Desert Online Remastered

You may remember what I said about this game back in 2018. During this segment, I claimed that “nothing has changed”. That’s not exactly true. There are some changes beyond the addition of shinier pixels:

The early game has been truncated. The entire starting town is now abandoned and players begin the game in the second quest hub, with the leveling scaled so that you breeze through the first 7 levels in the space of a couple of minutes. Not sure why that was done, but I guess it doesn’t harm anything. The story is incomprehensible dross anyway, so throwing a tiny bit of it away isn’t a bad thing. I suspect this was done to speed things up because they’re in a hurry to get players to the level cap where they can be milked for pay-to-win PvP bullshit.

The inventory space restrictions have been greatly relaxed. You start the game with 40 inventory slots instead of (IIRC) 15 or 20. Again, they’re taking the focus off the early game and pushing players towards the more lucrative endgame.

The game is even more absurd with in-game money than before. My character was a multimillionaire before they hit level 10. Peasants casually hand out gold bars for performing mundane tasks. Of course, nothing you really want can be purchased with the in-game money, because the developers want you to buy those things with your actual money. 

The game now installs XIGNCODE3 anti-cheat on your PC without asking or even telling you, and the program remains running even when BDO isn’t runningI un-installed the game as soon as I discovered this. It LOOKS like XIGNCODE is also uninstalled, but I’ve read reports from people who claim it sticks around.. 

That’s it. The interface and dialog are still horribly translated, you still level too fast to enjoy the combat, which is the only system in the game that works. The game is still focused on creating inconveniences for the player and then renting them the outrageously overpriced solution at the needlessly convoluted cash shop. And even if you muddle through all of that, the game just dumps you into PvP – willing or not – at the end of your journey.

<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Hi! Hope you’re doing well! I’ve got a question about Tabletop RPGs (TTRPGs) – which, unfortunately, is mostly aimed at Shamus. Sorry, Paul! I’ve tried playing RPGs myself, but it turns out that playing them just isn’t for me (it’s a long story). </p>
<p>However, I love talking about TTRPG design, as well as reading about TTRPG campaigns. But no matter how many I read, the one about Mar Tesaro is the best one I’ve ever come across (I still reread it from time to time). Now, Shamus, you’ve described the obstacles you have with running a TT game nowadays (health, schedules, players in different states, etc.). However, have you considered running an online TTRPG with your friends? Nowadays, there are a literal ton of resources geared towards it – from sites like Roll20 and Tabletop Finder, all the way to worldbuilding resources like World Anvil. </p>
<p>I realise this question is kind of personal, so I won’t mind it if you choose not to answer. I just thought it was a natural workaround to your burning hatred for all things small, cute and furry.</p>

<p>Also, here’s the link to <a href="http://blog.hawkbats.com/2017/03/22/pondermull-campaign/">the old TTRPG campaign</a> Paul mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>48:53 Mailbag: Egypt: Old Kingdom</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Lately I’ve been playing a lot of Egypt: Old Kingdom, a strategy game set in ancient Egypt which prides itself on its historical accuracy and its educational qualities.  The endgame is based on a period of history called the Bronze Age Collapse, during which a mysterious group known as the Sea People repeatedly attacked Egypt.  The historical Sea People temporarily conquered northern Egypt.  In the game, the Sea People are an endless series of increasingly large armies who will keep coming until every single Egyptian everywhere is dead.  My question is this:  did the game get history wrong by exaggerating the danger posed by the Sea People or did it get history right by giving me the same sort of visceral, deep-seated fear of the Sea People that at least some of the ancient Egyptians must have felt?  What would you say it means for a game to get history right?</p>

<strong>00:00 Moving day is here</strong></p>
<p>Like I said, I’ll try to keep this place from falling apart this week, but things will be hectic. Between the move and my ongoing efforts to NOT DIE AT 48 YEARS OLD<span class="snote" title="1">See below.</span>, I’ve got a lot on my plate this week.</p>
<p><strong>04:00 Cyberpunk DELAYED</strong></p>
<p>Oh, <em>Watchdogs: Legion</em> was delayed an indefinite amount of time? That sucks, but at least I still have Cyberpunk 2077 in September.</p>
<p>Shit. <em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em> has been delayed an indefinite amount of time. That sucks, but at least I still have Cyberpunk 2077 in September.</p>
<p>Dangit, <em>Bloodlines 2</em> has been delayed an indefinite amount of time. That sucks, but at least I still have Cyberpunk 2077 in September.</p>
<p>Aw. <em>Doom Eternal</em> was a bit of a disappointment. It’s not horrible, but it doesn’t have the magic of Doom 2016. That sucks, but at least I still have Cyberpunk 2077 in September.</p>
<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator seems to be stuck in beta-test limbo and we still don’t have a release date. That sucks, but at least I still have Cyberpunk 2077 in September.</p>
<p>ARRRRG! <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> Has been delayed until November. </p>
<p>So now we have the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ow-M-1K_c">EA Play Event</a> and <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=50146">the Playstation 5 reveal</a>. They’re trying to get us excited for the games of 2021 and 2022, when WE’RE STILL WAITING FOR THE GAMES OF 2020 TO COME OUT. We don’t even have a release date for most of these!</p>
<p>I imagine all of these idiots are going to fight over the Christmas season. Joke’s on you, publishers. I’m going to play Cyberpunk 2077 the whole time. Maybe you should have released your games ANYWHERE in the first three quarters of the year, when people had time for them. </p>
<p>Of course, a lot of this was caused by Covid-19. It’s really hard to get physical copies printed and shipped, and half the retail outlets were closed anyway. Still, if I was in charge of the release date for these games, I’d rather take my chances going all-digital than go head-to-head with <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> during the all-or-nothing Christmas rush.</p>
<p><strong>09:29 Paul was laid off.</strong></p>
<p>Good luck Paul! Hope you land a job soon. </p>
<p><strong>11:30 Shamus health emergency</strong></p>
<p>For those of you who don’t listen to the show, here is the short version: I saw the doctor back in March-ish. At the time, he said my blood pressure was borderline and I was at risk for developing hypertension. I figured it was time to get in shape. </p>
<p>But then the COVID-19 quarantine happened and I forgot all about it. I stopped taking walks and hid in the house for 3 months while pigging out on salty starches. I put on a ton of weight and got really out-of-shape.</p>
<p>So last week I got around to taking my blood pressure and it was 185/125. I didn’t know what that meant, so I looked it up and discovered that these numbers are REALLY BAD and I’m at greatly-elevated risk for heart attack, stroke, and eyesight damage<span class="snote" title="2">One of the things that tipped me off that something was wrong was seeing spots in front of my eyes. Apparently that pressure can be really damaging to the sensitive optic nerve.</span>. Those are all extraordinarily bad things, so now we’re in panic mode trying to fix this. </p>
<p><strong>19:04&nbsp;Opus Magnum</strong></p>
<p>Finally, some non-bad news! I really, really LOVE this game. I can’t stop playing / thinking about it. Also, it has this cool feature where you can save a puzzle solution as a gif…<br>
</p><p></p>
<p><strong>25:18 Noita</strong></p>
<p>Paul is still playing this game. I might come back to it in a few months and see what’s changed. (It’s still in early access.)</p>
<p><strong>26:29&nbsp;Mailbag: Lazy Cliffhanger Endings</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>I recently finished a game that had a very deliberately “shocking” twist/cliffhanger.</p>
<p>The big bad evil antagonist showed up, using a teleportation spell that the Royal Guard spent five years perfecting despite only four days having passed since the beginning of the game; they immediately recognized the new party member was a robot, despite robots not existing in the place they all came from (which was a major plot point in the game); the usually kind and cheerful protagonist told the best friend character to chop the antagonists limbs off;…</p>
<p>In short, it was a complete mess clearly designed to spur players to buy the sequel, and it left me completely cold.</p>
<p>Have you guys been turned off of a game by a very badly telegraphed, BLAM cliffhanger? If not in an earlier installment, maybe in promotional material? And if so, did you eventually give in and check the game out anyway, or did you stick to your guns and leave it alone?</p>

Back when I began getting more into games and started playing through self-aware titles like Spec Ops: The Line and Undertale, I very much had the mindset of “Ah yes, Nathan Drake kills a 1000 people, therefore ludonarrative dissonance, therefore game bad.” I think what shifted my perspective was Uncharted 4. You still kill a crazy amount of people, but the ratio between gunfights and nonviolent activities has shifted dramatically. I suppose you could say they injected way more “quiet time” into the game. For me personally, it went a long ways to making me feel more like a scrappy adventurer and less like a mass murderer. The real issue was never body count, but instead pacing. So that was a really long-winded saying its more complicated than I realized and I’m curious when this particular bit of “video-gameyness” becomes bothersome to you guys if at all.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>38:26&nbsp;Mailbag: Shapes.io</strong></p>

<p><strong>43:25&nbsp;Mailbag: Microsoft Sucks</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Hi! Hope you two are doing well! I’m an old*, whiney, and stubborn curmudgeon, who’s always stuck in his ways. As such, I’m still using Windows 7, and dread the day I’ll be forced to upgrade to 10 (which I’ve used, and thoroughly hate). </p>
<p>But to my surprise, Windows 7 keeps getting security updates, even though they said they’ve stopped supporting it. One day, I turned on my PC, started working, and saw I had another Windows update. “Neat!” I thought, clicked “OK”, and carried on working. About 10 minutes later I was deep into looking at the remote client to my office computer. Suddenly, my machine froze, giving me a nonsense error to the effect of “Can’t create a file that already exists” (I don’t remember the exact wording)! </p>
<p>After about 20 seconds, my PC it rectified itself, and Windows Update told me “To apply the changes, save everything, and RESTART NOW!!!”. Needless to say, I had to stop working, and restart. This was obviously a very important update!</p>
<p>But after I logged back into my profile, ready to reopen the programs I need for work, I was greeted by a white screen with blue text asking me to “Save my preferences” and “Get Started”. I received a mini heart attack, thinking I had to spend the entire day (probably week!) fussing with reinstalling Windows. </p>
<p>To my relief, I quickly saw that this wasn’t a request for reinstalling Windows. “Phew!”, I thought. Yet my relief was quickly replaced with outrage. Because this white “screen with blue text” was actually a new program – Microsoft Edge. Turns out, the only purpose of this update was to install their obnoxious Win 10 browser that I never asked for!</p>
<p>Now, I’m sure all of this comes as a surprise to both of you – as you know, Microsoft is a company who value their users’ preferences and freedom, and it’s very uncharacteristic of them to interrupt our work, just so they can impose their decisions on our machines without even asking.</p>
<p>But just on the off-chance that you aren’t at all surprised – what is the worst way a Windows update (or decision) has made you angry?</p>
<p>Keep Being Awesome,</p>
<p>Lino</p></blockquote>
<p>The anecdote I referred to during this segment can be found here: <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=34549">This Dumb Industry: The Windows 10 Store</a></p>
<p><strong>49:25 Shamus is going to build a file server?</strong></p>
<p>For you non-listeners who still read the show notes, here is a reverse-mailbag situation where I ask the question and hopefully some of you answer.</p>
<p>Issac and I need to share a lot of large files to produce the Diecast / This Dumb Industry videos. Currently, I upload to Dropbox and then he downloads them. This means that the files need to go out to the internet and back, eating up bandwidth, wasting our time, and lowering video quality for anyone watching Netflix. I could share a drive with him, but I want the files to be available even if my computer is off / sleeping.</p>
<p>So I figured It might be a good idea to set up a dedicated machine to hold the files. We even have a really old 64 bit computer that’s unfit for gaming. I’m thinking I could set that up in a closet or wherever and share a drive with both of us. </p>
<p>The problem is that I know sharing over a local network is always about 10x more difficult than it needs to be. Okay, the last time I tried this was in the Windows XP days. MAYBE everything is magically turnkey these days, but this is Microsoft we’re talking about. </p>
<p>It might be easier to set up a Linux box, but the odds of it being able to seamlessly share files with Windows are pretty low[ref|I’m willing to bet that if such a feature existed in Linux, it would be one of those things that mysteriously breaks every time Windows updates. I could also set up an FTP server, but for the sake of workflow we’d prefer to have access to this drive and be able to browse it using File Explorer.</p>
<p>Usually, there’s one right way to do something like this and a dozen wrong ways, and I’d love it if I could skip some of the trial-and-error. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4092694/windows-10-file-sharing-over-a-network">Microsoft removed the HomeGroup stuff and replaced it with thing new</a>. (The HomeGroup stuff is still available via workarounds.) I could just follow the directions on the linked page, but <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=34749">this ain’t my first Microsoft rodeo</a>. </p>
<p>So my questions: </p>
<ol>
<li>Any advice? There’s nothing more frustrating than setting something up and then having someone ask you, “Why didn’t you do Obvious Thing X? It would have been way better!”</li>
<li>What’s the preferred way to set this up these days?</li>
<li>What security concerns do I need to worry about? Is it possible for the external internet to exploit this system?
</li></ol>

Show notes:
00:00 Moving day is here

Like I said, I’ll try to keep this place from falling apart this week, but things will be hectic. Between the move and my ongoing efforts to NOT DIE AT 48 YEARS OLDSee below., I’ve got a lot on my plate this week.

04:00 Cyberpunk DELAYED

Oh, Watchdogs: Legion was delayed an indefinite amount of time? That sucks, but at least I still have Cyberpunk 2077 in September.

Shit. Kerbal Space Program 2 has been delayed an indefinite amount of time. That sucks, but at least I still have Cyberpunk 2077 in September.

Dangit, Bloodlines 2 has been delayed an indefinite amount of time. That sucks, but at least I still have Cyberpunk 2077 in September.

Aw. Doom Eternal was a bit of a disappointment. It’s not horrible, but it doesn’t have the magic of Doom 2016. That sucks, but at least I still have Cyberpunk 2077 in September.

Microsoft Flight Simulator seems to be stuck in beta-test limbo and we still don’t have a release date. That sucks, but at least I still have Cyberpunk 2077 in September.

ARRRRG! Cyberpunk 2077 Has been delayed until November. 

So now we have the EA Play Event and the Playstation 5 reveal. They’re trying to get us excited for the games of 2021 and 2022, when WE’RE STILL WAITING FOR THE GAMES OF 2020 TO COME OUT. We don’t even have a release date for most of these!

I imagine all of these idiots are going to fight over the Christmas season. Joke’s on you, publishers. I’m going to play Cyberpunk 2077 the whole time. Maybe you should have released your games ANYWHERE in the first three quarters of the year, when people had time for them. 

Of course, a lot of this was caused by Covid-19. It’s really hard to get physical copies printed and shipped, and half the retail outlets were closed anyway. Still, if I was in charge of the release date for these games, I’d rather take my chances going all-digital than go head-to-head with Cyberpunk 2077 during the all-or-nothing Christmas rush.

09:29 Paul was laid off.

Good luck Paul! Hope you land a job soon. 

11:30 Shamus health emergency

For those of you who don’t listen to the show, here is the short version: I saw the doctor back in March-ish. At the time, he said my blood pressure was borderline and I was at risk for developing hypertension. I figured it was time to get in shape. 

But then the COVID-19 quarantine happened and I forgot all about it. I stopped taking walks and hid in the house for 3 months while pigging out on salty starches. I put on a ton of weight and got really out-of-shape.

So last week I got around to taking my blood pressure and it was 185/125. I didn’t know what that meant, so I looked it up and discovered that these numbers are REALLY BAD and I’m at greatly-elevated risk for heart attack, stroke, and eyesight damageOne of the things that tipped me off that something was wrong was seeing spots in front of my eyes. Apparently that pressure can be really damaging to the sensitive optic nerve.. Those are all extraordinarily bad things, so now we’re in panic mode trying to fix this. 

19:04 Opus Magnum

Finally, some non-bad news! I really, really LOVE this game. I can’t stop playing / thinking about it. Also, it has this cool feature where you can save a puzzle solution as a gif…



25:18 Noita

Paul is still playing this game. I might come back to it in a few months and see what’s changed. (It’s still in early access.)

26:29 Mailbag: Lazy Cliffhanger Endings

Dear Diecast,
I recently finished a game that had a very deliberately “shocking” twist/cliffhanger.
The big bad evil antagonist showed up, using a teleportation spell that the Royal Guard spent five years perfecting despite only four days having passed since the beginning of the game; they im…</itunes:summary>

<p><strong>02:34 Take-Two’s nefarious backstab. </strong></p>
<p>During this segment, Paul played devil’s advocate and proposed an alternate theory for Take-Two’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-03/kerbal-space-program-2-release-disrupted-by-corporate-strife">egregious behavior</a>: What if the developers were doing a bad job and TT just wanted to get the project back on track?</p>
<p>This theory is a little wobbly, since TT was trying to poach the team for <em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em>. If they’re doing a bad job, then why are you trying to hire them? But you could fix this by suggesting that, perhaps, the leadership of indie developer Star Theory was terrible / difficult to work with. So maybe TT just wanted the team under their own leadership.

The Star Theory leadership refuses to accept any changes. Now imagine you’re the president of Take-Two, and let’s also imagine you’re basically a good person that wants to put out a decent game. What’s your move?</p>
<ol>
<li>Take the project away from the current developers and hand it to a new team. It will take MONTHS to hire a fresh batch of devs, and more time for those people to coalesce into a creative&nbsp; team, and more months for those new people to decipher this half-constructed game so they can get the project back on track. <strong>Result: Star Theory goes out of business, the current devs become unemployed, and the game is pushed back a year.</strong></li>
<li>Cut your losses and start over with a different studio. <strong>Result: Star Theory goes out of business, the current devs become unemployed, and the game is pushed back two or three years.</strong></li>
<li>Go to the developer and issue an ultimatum that they need to change course. <strong>Result: The devs call up Jason Schreier, who publishes an exposé about how the heavy-handed publisher is “ruining” the game with strong-arm tactics by threatening to shut the project down. Nothing changes, the game continues on its misguided course, you get a bunch of bad press, and now you’re forced to pick one of the other options in this list. Also, when the game finally comes out, you’ll be blamed for the lack of quality.</strong></li>
<li>Start a new studio and cut funding to Star Theory. Attempt to “quietly” offer the current rank-and-file creative people the opportunity to join the new studio. <strong>Result: Star Theory goes out of business, the current devs can join the new studio and smooth out the transition, and the game gets pushed back just a few months.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In this scenario, I think that Take-Two’s behavior would represent the least bad of all of the available options.</p>
<p><strong>12:45 Paul plays Obduction</strong></p>

<p><strong>35:38 Mailbag: AI Cheating</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hello Diecast,</p>
<p>Your last episode’s segment on Civ VI, and some of the comments it inspired, brought to mind a related topic I have felt passionately about since first getting into strategy games as a child: AI cheating, wherein AI players get to do things like ignore fog of war, receive free resources from the ether, what have you. I hate it. It sucks. It’s also a near universal staple of the genre, as well as many others.</p>
<p>There are valid reasons for this. I’m in the software field, and I fully understand why good AI is so rare and challenging to implement, as well as the game designer’s dilemma that AI that was genuinely really good probably wouldn’t be all that fun to play against either. The ubiquity of aggressively stupid AIs that cheat like hell suggests that’s the best tradeoff for designers to take, but designers don’t always make the best choices. Can you think of AIs in games, from any genres, that you found particularly memorable? Challenging, devious, at times possibly quite dastardly, but still clearly fair and playing by the rules?</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

<p><strong>49:21 Mailbag: Difficulty</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Shamus and Paul!</p>
<p>I have been enjoying listening to the Diecast for quite a while and have recently returned to it, listening through old and new ones. Really appreciate it. In any case, question below:</p>
<p>Difficulty is something that comes up with some frequency both on the Diecast and the Blog. Not really surprising considering that games tend to work by different rules, have different mechanics, pacing and so on and so forth. Now, what I had been wondering about is the question what kind of difficulty is particularly tough on you. Or rather: Are there genres that you have an easier time with than with others?</p>
<p>For instance, “the mystical Quicksave key” (as Yathzee once put it) is something that makes me shrug off repeated deaths in FPS’ comparatively easily and I suppose this is likely the same for many other people. With RTS’ on the other hand I tend to break off campaigns early if the difficulty ramps up too quickly and I have no other reasons (story, atmosphere) to continue. And that’s in spite of being fairly competent in that genre. I also tend to have trouble with difficult RPGs that are relatively open. The old Fallouts and especially Temple of Elemental Evil are good examples. Icewind Dale II is difficult but linear. ToEE on the other hand is difficult and is fairly open in a number of ways. Thus it’s often difficult to know what the problem is, when having trouble with an encounter. ToEE is pretty much the threshold for me, with Dark Souls already being on the other side. Excessive Trial-and-Error, Third-Person-timing-based combat, long runs back to encounters, shitty port etc. all contribute to it for me.</p>
<p>Tl;dr:<br>
What kind of factors such as game mechanics, difficulty design, game length, pacing, weak story or writing, weak atmosphere, uninteresing setting etc. contribute to you personal diffulty threshold? (Especially in regards to some recently mentioned titles such as Dark Souls and Doom Eternal.)</p>
<p>Greetings, WaveofKittens</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>56:02 Mailbag: Historical Preservation</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hello Shamus &amp; Paul,</p>
<p>Since 2009 I have belonged to a group that has been attempting to create a free private server for the NCSoft MMO Tabula Rasa. It has been a difficult process because NCSoft continues to issue cease and desist orders for a game that was shut down 11 years ago.</p>
<p>Do you think historical preservation is important for online games such as this? Why or why not?</p>
<p>May all your hits be crits,<br>

<p><strong>0:29 Shamus’ House</strong></p>
<p>I’ll repeat this here for those of you who don’t listen to the show: Our family is moving. As of right now, it looks like it’ll happen in early July. I’ll do what I can to keep the content mill going, but you know it goes. Hopefully we won’t wind up with a <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=24589">five day internet blackout</a> like we had <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=24592">last time</a>.</p>
<p><strong>6:56 Noita</strong></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>32:50 Denuvo Anti-Cheat</strong></p>
<p>Eurogamer has a run-down of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-05-21-doom-eternal-removing-denuvo-anti-cheat-following-backlash">whole thing</a>. </p>
<p>Like I said on the show, I uninstalled the <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=49582">Bethesda Launcher</a> the moment I heard about a Doom Eternal update that installs anti-cheat at the <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(computer_science)">kernel</a> level. Now the question: If I previously installed the Bethesda launcher with admin privs, what are the odds that the update would need to ask for privs again before installing something like Denuvo Anti-Cheat? I know it’s POSSIBLE to set things up so that it never needs to ask for privs again, but Bethesda developers are demonstrably lazy and very likely to take the path of least resistance in any given task. And I’m 99% sure that in this case, the path of least resistance would require an additional popup asking for privileges. Since I never saw one, I’m reasonably sure that Bethesda didn’t mess with my operating system.</p>

Show notes:

0:29 Shamus’ House

I’ll repeat this here for those of you who don’t listen to the show: Our family is moving. As of right now, it looks like it’ll happen in early July. I’ll do what I can to keep the content mill going, but you know it goes. Hopefully we won’t wind up with a five day internet blackout like we had last time.

6:56 Noita




32:50 Denuvo Anti-Cheat

Eurogamer has a run-down of the whole thing. 

Like I said on the show, I uninstalled the Bethesda Launcher the moment I heard about a Doom Eternal update that installs anti-cheat at the kernel level. Now the question: If I previously installed the Bethesda launcher with admin privs, what are the odds that the update would need to ask for privs again before installing something like Denuvo Anti-Cheat? I know it’s POSSIBLE to set things up so that it never needs to ask for privs again, but Bethesda developers are demonstrably lazy and very likely to take the path of least resistance in any given task. And I’m 99% sure that in this case, the path of least resistance would require an additional popup asking for privileges. Since I never saw one, I’m reasonably sure that Bethesda didn’t mess with my operating system.

47:54 Mailbag: Civ 6

Hi Shamus
I was listening to your recent Diecast where you talk about buying Civilisation VI with that weird coupon from Civilisation V. I now see the Epic Game store is giving away Civilisation VI for free. Do you take this as further confirmation that the Epic Game store is out to aggravate you, personally, and damn the cost?

You are famous for nitpicking on games “everyone else” loves (The New Collosus, ME2), but are there any examples the other way around. Are there games (video/board/cards) you love/like which everyone else hates?
My example would be Dragon Age 2. I read admiration for Origins everywhere and hate for the second series entry. It’s pretty much the opposite for me.

<strong>01:10 Mailbag: Games that are too Good</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Sometimes when I’m done with playing a game that I really liked – and had a particularly good time with it – it can result in a situation where I don’t want to replay it ever again, in fear of my memories being better than reality (because, who knows, maybe it wasn’t so good after all? Maybe it correlated with the interests/obsessions I had then, but not now?). Has this ever happened to you? If so, why?</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,<br>
I really like the fact that you’re a videogame podcast named after tabletop RPGs, whose hosts like getting sidetracked by all number of other topics!<br>
So, I’d like to ask: would you like to get sidetracked into talking about sci-fi books? What sci-fi books have you read recently (or not so recently) that have left an impression on you? What did you like/not like about them? Do you think any of their ideas can be adapted to videogames?<br>
Keep being Awesome,<br>

<blockquote><p>Hi Paul! Hi Shamus!<br>
(For some reason this order of names sounds better than the reverse one) </p>
<p>Is there a game (or series,  or genre) where the trial and error approach to gameplay situations is frequently present,  but that’s not frustrating to you,  but the opposite – it’s fun and you enjoy the game?</p>

This question is as much for your readers as for you. I picked up Borderlands 3 when it finally released on Steam. I have really been enjoying the game, but have been curious about my experience. Six months and 2 DLC’s later, have you gone back and seen if the experience was the same for you? I haven’t been experiencing what you did (which kind of had me on the fence before playing it) and I was wondering if your experience with the bullet sponges and weapon power have changed? Also, I enjoyed your dissection of the previous games, and wondered what your opinion of the overall plot and tone of three were? Recently rereading your earlier posts, I think some of the unanswered questions from earlier games (i.e. Zarpadon and blowing up the moon) were answered. How would you rate or compare this and is there ever a chance we might get a series of articles on it?<br>
Anyways thank you for your website, in these times it is even more enjoyable than ever,</p>

<p><strong>35:44 Mailbag: Fading Genres</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>In the last Diecast you mentioned as an aside that Tower Defense games have “sorta vanished”, despite having been very popular for a while. This got me thinking of other genres of games that have, if not died, then faded to a shadow of their former selves: point &amp; click adventure games, real time strategy games, and now tower defense. </p>
<p>So my question is: what genres do you think are on their way out, and are there any where you’d hope that they’d vanish? Is there anything you think is due for a renaissance, like how Rogue/Roguelikes have reappeared?</p>

<p><strong>49:56 Mailbag: Historical Accuracy</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Recently I’ve been in a mood for anything related to the French Revolution – including games. This led me to playing two titles – We. The Revolution and Assassin’s Creed: Unity. Both of these games take certain „liberties” with source materials, but from different reasons, which I found interesiting.<br>
In „We…” the player acts as a judge in the Revolutionary Court. Therefore you can occasionally change the way certain trials concluded (for example, you can decide that Danton is innocent and let him live). Players agency, combined with the huge integration of the story with events that took place during that historical period means that the game can’t remain faithful to these events – which in my opinion is the correct approach in an interactive medium. But then the game went so far in its third act that it wasn’t really about Revolution anymore. You couldn’t experience that period because there was so much changes that it made the whole affair almost unrecognizable (hard to say anything without spoilers, but I suspect that the developers wanted to make sure that players’ choices would still have an emotional impact).</p>
<p>But then AC: U happened, which somehow managed to create a story that is almost completely detached from the French Revolution – it might as well never have happened, story-wise nothing would be different. When it finally does something related to that historical period (practically at the very end), it’s only to push its own story about the struggles of assassins and templars with each others, which is much less interesting than the actual events that happened. And it actually pushes the story even further from the French Revolution (my guess is that Ubisoft was really afraid to say something about such a controversial topic).</p>
<p>But that made me think – how far you can go with altering historical events in a video games? Should there be limits for players’ interactivity in the name of historical accuracy or the other way around – should events always be determined by their choices? AC: U didn’t want to change anything (or even say anything) and it turned the French Revolution into unnecessary background noise. We. The Revolution has changed too much and it wasn’t about this subject anymore. Is there a line to draw? Some elements that shouldn’t be changed no matter what? Certain topics, themes? Or maybe the deveoplers should go all-in and changed everything they want?</p>

<p><strong>58:28 Mailbag: Value of Games</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>One of my earliest memories is the first time I ever played a video game at a neighbour’s house. The cheerful music, colourful visuals and apparent miracle of the input/feedback loop by which I was able to control the little blue hedgehog made me an instant convert to gaming for life.</p>
<p>What I’ve always loved most about games is the way you can become completely absorbed in the activity of playing them – to become an inhabitant of the universe of the game. It isn’t just that they’re fun, although I’ve played many fun games. I’ve always struggled to articulate exactly what I mean by this, but the best way I can describe it is that, at its best, gaming somehow manages to achieve a state of meaningfulness.</p>
<p>Even among the enthusiast press, when the value of games is discussed, it’s often in terms of their potential for social or personal improvement, or as a jumping-off point into the rabbit hole of how we define capital-A art. But I seldom recall seeing much discussion of the value of gaming just as it is, in spite of the the livelihood it has made for thousands and the passion it inspires in millions. At best the nebulous benefits of leisure time and escapism are acknowledged, only to be countervailed with concerns about laziness, toxicity and retreat from reaility. The wider media takes an even dimmer view.</p>
<p>I’d like to know what other people think about this. Do games matter? Can gaming be meaningful? Have others found an instrinc value in playing games, or are their potential benefits considered to be more limited and utilitarian?</p>
<p>Congratulations on reaching 300 episodes,</p>

<p><strong>1:03:01 Mailbag: Taking Notes</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>conglaturations* on another milestone reached! You guys make my Mondays far less of a pain than they could be, thanks for all the entertainment.</p>
<p>Recently I was digging through my physical game archive and I came across my notes for Pokemon. I used to keep track of which ‘mon I saw where and at which levels so I could return there after fighting the Elite 4 (or after defeating Red in Pokemon Gold/Silver/Crystal). I also took careful notes on where I saw trees that could be cut down, pools of water that could be crossed, and other such obstacles that may hold points of interest.</p>
<p>Nowadays I still do a bunch of note taking, even though ever more information is easily accessible online and there is less need for me to do so.</p>
<p>How about you guys? Do you take notes while playing? I imagine Shamus jots down a lot for articles on the site.</p>

<p><strong>1:07:51 Mailbag: Game it out</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Shamus and Paul.</p>
<p>I’ve been watching a Youtube channel that I think you guys would find interesting. It’s called “Let’s Game It Out” – most videos focus on one of the myriad of low-budget ‘tycoon’ or ‘simulator’ style games out there, playing them in the most absurd way possible.  He finds hilarious ways to exploit broken mechanics and push systems past their breaking point). As an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVt5my65WL8 – playing Smartphone Tycoon, he designs terrible phones and sells them at ridiculous prices, but somehow is successful enough to sell 34 quadrillion phones by the end.</p>
<p>He’s also done a whole series of videos on Satisfactory, – the first of which is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vYYhL9Vt8o.  They get progressively more ambitious (and physics-breaking) as they go.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy them.<br>

01:10 Mailbag: Games that are too Good

Dear Diecast,
Sometimes when I’m done with playing a game that I really liked – and had a particularly good time with it – it can result in a situation where I don’t want to replay it ever again, in fear of my memories being better than reality (because, who knows, maybe it wasn’t so good after all? Maybe it correlated with the interests/obsessions I had then, but not now?). Has this ever happened to you? If so, why?
Regards,
Darek
04:24 Mailbag: Sci-fi Books

Dear Diecast,
I really like the fact that you’re a videogame podcast named after tabletop RPGs, whose hosts like getting sidetracked by all number of other topics!
So, I’d like to ask: would you like to get sidetracked into talking about sci-fi books? What sci-fi books have you read recently (or not so recently) that have left an impression on you? What did you like/not like about them? Do you think any of their ideas can be adapted to videogames?
Keep being Awesome,
Lino
15:35 Mailbag: Trial and Error Games

Hi Paul! Hi Shamus!
(For some reason this order of names sounds better than the reverse one) 
Is there a game (or series,  or genre) where the trial and error approach to gameplay situations is frequently present,  but that’s not frustrating to you,  but the opposite – it’s fun and you enjoy the game?
Also, happy This Is Sparta Diecast! Congratulations!

This got me thinking of other genres of games that have, if not died, then faded to a shadow of their former selves: point &amp; click adventure games, real time strategy games, and now tower defense.

<p>A few examples from the post:<br>
  * Amnesia contains a tip that monsters can find you easier when you have low sanity which is not true.<br>
  * In the Batman: Arkham trilogy, mooks spend most of their time posturing and position themselves so that you can keep your combo going.<br>
  * Fire Emblem displays wrong to-hit chances, player characters actually get to roll twice with the displayed chance. (So 90% is actually 99%.)</p>
<p>What are your opinions on stuff like this?</p>
<p>Personally, I wouldn’t even classify the second thing as a lie, it’s pretty obvious that Batman mooks follow some fight scene choreography protocol. The hit-chance thing is something that really bugs me, though. If a game shows me a probability, I don’t want it to be fudged according to some ad-hoc theory about how “normal people” interpret probability. Why not make it green/yellow/red if you just want to convey some intuitive idea?</p>
<p>I knew the Fire Emblem thing, but one of the reblogs points out that the XCOM remake invisibly adjusts hit chances except when playing on hard, so you might bump up the difficulty and notice that you hit less often than you’re used to without knowing why. That seems even worse.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Have you heard of a game called Scorn? It’s not been released, but there’s a trailer and a bit of information out. The game is essentially ‘explore H.R.

<p>Unfortunately…the game was originally meant to be released in two parts, with the first arriving in October 2018. Then the developers announced that they were going to push the date back and release it all together. We basically haven’t heard anything in the two years since that announcement.</p>
<p>So — have you heard about the game? What do you think of it, based on the information available? Do you think it’s just taking a long time because game development is hard, or do you think it’s vaporware?</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear DIECAST,</p>
<p>I enjoyed  hearing you talk about the new DOOM game (DOOM V?). I have had a lot of fun with DOOM II, but have never played DOOM. Is it worth checking out or would you miss the super shotgun too much?</p>
<p>Also, I would love to hear your thoughts on the 2D Duke Nukem games.</p>
<p>Sincerely, BadIdeas</p>
<p>PS Happy Easter<br>
oh wait that was cancelled – wasn’t it</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>44:29 Mailbag: Games that Run Out</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Do you ever find yourself putting a game down before finishing it, not because it’s bad, but rather due to feeling like you’ve gotten everything you can out of it and not seeing a reason to continue?</p>
<p>My personal examples would be: DUSK (after the first episode), the original Flashback (after winning the ticket back to Earth in the ‘Running Man’-esque level). I enjoyed both, but stopped playing each with a sense of: “Okay, that’s what it is, cool, I get it – let’s play something else now”.</p>
<p>Best,<br>

12:15 Mailbag: Lying to players

Deeeeaaar Diecast,
I found an interesting blog post about games lying to players to improve the experience: https://askagamedev.tumblr.com/post/612309635577397248/i-just-watched-a-war-story-from-a-developer-of

<p>I am a huge fan of Fallout: New Vegas, however, everything grows a bit stale over time. I am considering purchasing Fallout and Fallout 2, but I am hesitant because they are really old and while I love Fallout: New Vegas, I can’t stand Fallout 3 or 4. Furthermore, Shamus has said some of the problems started with Fallout 2, but I have never heard anyone talk about Fallout 2 unless they were rightfully moaning about what Bethesda did to Jet. What were some of the major issues that started with Fallout 2?  Should I deep dive into the original games or mod the everloving hell out of Fallout: New Vegas? If the latter, do you have any recommended mods?</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi!</p>
<p>I suppose, it’s more applicable to Shamus, but may be Paul would be happy to add his take as well?</p>
<p>We often talk about graphics in games, but rarely about sound (except music). I myself started to care about it, only when I bought a good headset few years ago and learned the usefulness of 3d positioning (plus, noticed small details in songs, I missed before).</p>
<p>So, I actually want to ask you two related questions:<br>
a) Which audio setup do you use? Audio card, headset/loudspeakers/etc?<br>
b) Were there any games, which audio/sounds you place in very high regard?</p>

<p><strong>53:43 Mailbag: Thief 2: 20th Anniversary</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi!</p>
<p>It’s 20th Anniversary of Thief 2 The Metal Age this week, and I’ve finished replaying it last week. And I saw some videos on the topic. So it got me in the mood. Outside of Hitman standing proud and tall, other great stealth series are, at best, dormant, while in other games stealth is treated as a shallow option to explosive violence (Dishonored / Assassin’s Creed / Uncharted). There are few indie titles (Aragami or Swindle), but nothing that makes crowds speak about them. I want to ask Paul (for a change), what’s his opinion on why there’s practically no pure stealth games these days?</p>
<p>Best regards, DeadlyDark!</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>56:37 Bonus: RPG elements in Doom</strong></p>
<p>Deadly Dark also asked an extra question:</p>
<blockquote><p>P.S. Ok, here’s the question for Shamus. What’s your opinion on quote on quote «rpg-elements» in Doom ‘16 and Eternal?</p></blockquote>

      <itunes:summary>These are strange times indeed. The news changes by the hour, it rarely agrees with itself, and everyone has a different story. We’re either getting to the end, or it’s only just begun. 

I have no idea what’s going on, but I’m just keeping my head down and writing. Hope you’re all safe out there.

Show notes:

00:00 How is isolation going?

How’s it going out there? Life as usual? Sheltering at home? Working while everyone else shelters?

14:04 Router crashes IE crashes laptop

I look forward to hearing your theories.

26:36 Internet and Napster

And then we talked about this for some reason.

30:37 Doom Eternal – final thoughts

‘Salright I guess. Had fun out of 10.

33:50 Watch Dogs: Not Even When Free

I suppose I could use this as an excuse to link to Campster’s video again, since he pretty much sums up all my gripes with the game. Also, I’m glad I didn’t play all the way to the end. Ugh.

37:52 Graveyard Keeper




45:50 UE Viewer

What an interesting project.

52:13 Mailbag: YouTube views

Dear Diecast,
This one is for Shamus, mostly . . . I stopped by your Youtube channel and was startled to discover that your “This Dumb Industry” videos had gone from having around 5-10k views each to having 50-200k.  Wow!  Big deal!  What happened?!

53:43 Mailbag: Thief 2: 20th Anniversary

Hi!
It’s 20th Anniversary of Thief 2 The Metal Age this week, and I’ve finished replaying it last week. And I saw some videos on the topic. So it got me in the mood. Outside of Hitman standing proud and tall, other great stealth series are, at best, dormant, while in other games stealth is treated as a shallow option to explosive violence (Dishonored / Assassin’s Creed / Uncharted). There are few indie titles (Aragami or Swindle), but nothing that makes crowds speak about them. I want to ask Paul (for a change), what’s his opinion on why there’s practically no pure stealth games these days?
Best regards, DeadlyDark!
56:37 Bonus: RPG elements in Doom

Deadly Dark also asked an extra question:

P.S. Ok, here’s the question for Shamus. What’s your opinion on quote on quote «rpg-elements» in Doom ‘16 and Eternal?
57:52 Mailbag: Star Trek Picard  

Shamus &amp; Paul, 
Now that the first season is complete, I’m really curious to hear your thoughts on Star Trek: Picard.

<p><strong>01:57 Corona</strong></p>
<p>I just closed Reddit, because I was SO sick of the constant Corona / toilet paper memes. Then I remembered we talked about it on the show. This wasn’t even a planned topic. We were talking about it just before starting the show, and then made a snap decision to add it to the agenda. </p>
<p>Sorry for adding to the pointless media deluge. I realize you probably come here to get <strong>away</strong> from this sort of thing. </p>
<p><strong>10:50 Naughty Dog Is Crunching</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://kotaku.com/as-naughty-dog-crunches-on-the-last-of-us-ii-developer-1842289962">Jason Schreier’s latest expose</a> is… not a surprise, but a sad read nonetheless. </p>
<p>During this segment, I commented that it wasn’t clear if the publisher was even AWARE that this was a problem. The story made it sound like employees were imposing crunch on themselves and the publisher wasn’t paying attention. But there’s a bit of the discussion that I overlooked, which is that one of the developers was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6N7FrFY-IA">threatened to keep quiet about the company’s crunch practices</a>. That sounds bad, but from context it sounds like this guy was threatened by the developer <strong>Naughty Dog</strong>, not publisher Sony. </p>
<p>In either case, you have management doing bad things, but I’d really love to know which management we should focus on. Consider the possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sony is deliberately creating unhealthy conditions because they want to ship the next game at any cost.
</li><li>One of the higher-ups at Naughty Dog is trying to advance his career by making it look like he’s a miracle worker, and to that end he’s squeezing his people really hard.
</li></ol>
<p>These are both bad, of course. But for whatever reason I personally find #2 to be more angering. It’s one thing to harm people on the other side of the world through negligence and apathy, but for me that’s not nearly as bad as harming the people you see every day due to callousness and personal ambition. </p>
<p>But I don’t know. As always, we’re peering through the cracks in the wall and trying to make guesses about what we’re seeing. Regardless of who is at fault, this is very bad for Naughty Dog. They lost 70% of their creative leads. That’s the same thing that killed BioWare. If you lose your key people, you lose your identity as a developer. </p>
<p>I’m very curious to see if all of this chaos will impact the final quality of <em>Last of Us II</em>. </p>

Or maybe you’re in one of the countries that won’t move for a few more weeks. Or maybe you’re in a country that did it a few weeks ago. Or maybe you’re from a sane country that doesn’t feel the need to fiddle with the clocks twice a year.</p>
<p>Oh well. Have fun coordinating your remote meetings / raid / Skype call / project updates with people around the world! Remember, this chaos and loss of sleep is all for the public good in ways that can’t be proven or measured.</p>

<p>Show notes:<span id="more-49457"></span></p>
<p><strong>00:00 Daylight Savings</strong></p>
<p>As I’ve whined in the past: This is a dumb, disruptive hardship that causes lots of confusion and features some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84aWtseb2-4">dubious and difficult-to-measure benefits</a>. I hate it and I wish we could collectively stop doing this to ourselves.</p>
<p>Also, as someone with sleep pattern troubles, this sort of nonsense is the <strong>last thing</strong> I need. (Although it’s less miserable these days since I set my own hours.)</p>
<p><strong>00:06 No Merch</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=49415">Based on your feedback</a>, I’m going to give the Patreon reward merch a miss. I’m not in a hurry to mess with merchandise. It doesn’t sound like there’s a lot of demand and there’s probably better ways to spend my time. Having said that, if I get a brilliant idea or if the mood takes me, then I might set up some small merch on one of the print-on-demand services at some point in the future.</p>
<p>This means we have once again returned to status quo. That’s my favorite kind of quo.</p>
<p><strong>06:34 GeForce NOW</strong></p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/3/2/21161372/nvidia-geforce-now-the-long-dark-removed">an overview of the story</a>.</p>
<p><strong>13:52 WordPress</strong></p>
<p><strong>20:37 The Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus Sucks</strong></p>
<p>Two years ago, I said the game <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=41551">wasn’t a lot of fun</a>. At the time, I assumed the game felt terrible to play because I was playing on a potato computer. But revisiting the game here in 2020, I can see I was being far too generous. I have a really strong PC now and I can play the game in its full 60FPS, <em>everything-set-to-ultra</em> glory. And now I can say definitively that this game is a mess. The shooting feels floaty. The level flow is atrocious. The kinaesthetics are worse. The animations are boring. The stealth makes no sense and feels like it was designed by someone who has never played a stealth game before. The environments are generic and repetitive.</p>
<p>It’s just bad. Shockingly bad.</p>
<p><strong>25:36 The Death of E3?</strong></p>
<p>Most of the key individuals and companies have pulled out. Nobody wants to go due to COVID-19 outbreak fears. If the big companies all skip E3 and discover they saved millions of dollars with no downside, then they’re probably going to wonder why they should come back next year.</p>
<p><strong>30:45 PAX East</strong></p>
<p>I keep telling myself: I’m going to go back one of these years. We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>35:23 Mailbag: Ending Endless Games</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>With linear games, you beat the campaign, maybe get all the collectibles, and you know you’ve finished. There’s no clear stopping point in games designed for endless replayability. I keep finding a game I love, playing it until I get bored, and walking away vaguely dissatisfied because even though I had a hundred hours of enjoyment, the most memorable part is that I quit on hour 101 when I wasn’t having any more fun.</p>
<p>How do you decide when to stop playing a game you could play forever, and how do you evaluate it when the game doesn’t change over time but your experience of it does?</p>
<p>Ninety-Three</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>41:02 Mailbag: Gaming as a new Parent</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast;</p>
<p>My wife and I brought home our first baby last month, and I’m curious to hear your experience with balancing a growing family and also relaxing to a videogame.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the “What have you been playing?” thread that went up a few weeks ago. If you don’t get around to setting up forums/Discord/whatever, can we have more of those threads as a semi-regular feature of the blog?</p>

<p>I was watching a talk by Catherine West (aka Kyren from Chucklefish) where she was talking about how various programming paradigms work (and break) when developing video games. I’ll put the link in the postscript. When Shamus was writing his series on Jai he also discussed the topic, so I thought it would be of interest to you.</p>

      <itunes:summary>I hope you remembered to set your clocks ahead on Saturday night. Unless you’re in the southern hemisphere, in which case you need to move them back. Or maybe you’re in one of the countries that won’t move for a few more weeks. Or maybe you’re in a country that did it a few weeks ago. Or maybe you’re from a sane country that doesn’t feel the need to fiddle with the clocks twice a year.

Oh well. Have fun coordinating your remote meetings / raid / Skype call / project updates with people around the world! Remember, this chaos and loss of sleep is all for the public good in ways that can’t be proven or measured.

Enjoy!

Show notes:

00:00 Daylight Savings

As I’ve whined in the past: This is a dumb, disruptive hardship that causes lots of confusion and features some dubious and difficult-to-measure benefits. I hate it and I wish we could collectively stop doing this to ourselves.

Also, as someone with sleep pattern troubles, this sort of nonsense is the last thing I need. (Although it’s less miserable these days since I set my own hours.)

00:06 No Merch

Based on your feedback, I’m going to give the Patreon reward merch a miss. I’m not in a hurry to mess with merchandise. It doesn’t sound like there’s a lot of demand and there’s probably better ways to spend my time. Having said that, if I get a brilliant idea or if the mood takes me, then I might set up some small merch on one of the print-on-demand services at some point in the future.

This means we have once again returned to status quo. That’s my favorite kind of quo.

06:34 GeForce NOW

Here’s an overview of the story.

13:52 WordPress

20:37 The Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus Sucks

Two years ago, I said the game wasn’t a lot of fun. At the time, I assumed the game felt terrible to play because I was playing on a potato computer. But revisiting the game here in 2020, I can see I was being far too generous. I have a really strong PC now and I can play the game in its full 60FPS, everything-set-to-ultra glory. And now I can say definitively that this game is a mess. The shooting feels floaty. The level flow is atrocious. The kinaesthetics are worse. The animations are boring. The stealth makes no sense and feels like it was designed by someone who has never played a stealth game before. The environments are generic and repetitive.

It’s just bad. Shockingly bad.

25:36 The Death of E3?

Most of the key individuals and companies have pulled out. Nobody wants to go due to COVID-19 outbreak fears. If the big companies all skip E3 and discover they saved millions of dollars with no downside, then they’re probably going to wonder why they should come back next year.

30:45 PAX East

I keep telling myself: I’m going to go back one of these years. We’ll see.

35:23 Mailbag: Ending Endless Games

With linear games, you beat the campaign, maybe get all the collectibles, and you know you’ve finished. There’s no clear stopping point in games designed for endless replayability. I keep finding a game I love, playing it until I get bored, and walking away vaguely dissatisfied because even though I had a hundred hours of enjoyment, the most memorable part is that I quit on hour 101 when I wasn’t having any more fun.
How do you decide when to stop playing a game you could play forever, and how do you evaluate it when the game doesn’t change over time but your experience of it does?

Dear Diecast;
My wife and I brought home our first baby last month, and I’m curious to hear your experience with balancing a growing family and also relaxing to a videogame.

<p><strong>11:49 Mailbag: Tomb Raider</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear diecast (although its mostly for Shamus, sorry Paul)</p>
<p>Since you’ve been hurting for mailbag questions, I’ll try to give you some. I recently sank my teeth in the tomb raider rereboot (2013, rise and shadow of the tomb raider). I remember Shamus being really positive about tomb raider 2013 but less so about rise of the tomb raider, and disliking shadow (if i interpreted his blog correctly). My question is: does Shamus dislike the changes the of the latest TR games, or did the rebooted TR series not sit well over time? What i mean is, would Shamus still be blown away by TR 2013 if it came out today, or was it just impressive in 2013. Should Shamus still enjoy enjoy replaying TR 2013 now?</p>
<p>With kind regards,<br>
Chiris</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>17:36 Mailbag: Overpowered in a Good Way</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>You recently praised Risk of Rain 2 for the fact that it allows the player to stack up bonuses without limit and become totally overpowered in a way most games don’t permit. Usually becoming overpowered is boring for the same reason that turning on god mode is boring, but every now and then I find a game like Noita or Slay The Spire where becoming way more powerful than the enemies somehow makes it fun instead of tedious to spend fifteen minutes effortlessly stomping everything. What do you think is the magic spark that makes this difference?</p>

<p><strong>25:51 Mailbag: The Forums</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast Shamus, (sorry Paul!)</p>
<p>Any update on whether the forums are coming back? If they aren’t coming back, is there any chance of making a data dump of the archives available? I’ve had times where I’ve wanted to refer back to some previous forum discussions since they’ve been down.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Relatedly, are there any changes that could be make to the blog to facilitate longer-term discussion? It seems blog discussions currently have a very short shelf-life: once a post is no longer the top post discussion mostly dies.</p>
<p>And when revisiting a comment section, it’s hard to find the new comments posted since I last visited; and to see if anyone has replied to anything I’ve said.</p>
<p>I know this probably means a terrible trip to the wonderful world of WordPress plugins, but if any of these could be addressed – email notifications, or a quick way of seeing new comments – I think it’d help the blog as a platform for discussion.</p>

<p><strong>26:50 Mailbag: Geforce Now</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>I’ve been watching release of Geforce Now with interest but it seems that the service is faltering somwhat… given that publishers are removing or withholding their games from the service. However, I’m a bit confused as to why this is an issue or why there are even “compatible” games for this service.</p>
<p>Geforce Now appears to effectively be a virtualised OS instance. I’ve checked several EULAs from various publishers and none of them prohibit the use of games on a virtual machine. They prohibit third party software that alters the game experience (mods/hacks/bots), reselling the software, etc. So, on what basis is this “removal” even taking place under? Why does NVidia even need to obtain permission from the publishers to run the games?</p>
<p>Maybe you have some insight into this or maybe it’ll spark a debate in the comments.</p>
<p>All the best,<br>

<p><strong>33:56 Mailbag: Heresy!</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,<br>
Not too long ago, I encountered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpCv12q6fFI">this video</a>. It makes the argument that Half-Life 2 is a bad sequel (though not necessarily a bad game). Now I’ve never properly played any of the Half-Life games (my attempt to play the series began and ended with 1, where my awful sense of direction served me very poorly), so I can’t make a properly informed assessment of the argument, but something struck me about it.</p>
<p>One of the points he makes is that HL2 throws away most of the interesting and unique story elements of 1, in favor of a safer and more cliched story. In particular, the game discards the original’s sequel hooks by introducing a new antagonist faction which comes out of nowhere, takes over the world, and is suddenly the most important thing ever. This sounds very familiar.<br>
So I wanted to see what you’d think of it. Given your fondness for the game, what’s your reaction to seeing someone make criticisms of it so similar to the ones you leveled at Mass Effect 2? Do you think they’re reasonable arguments, or do you think his analysis of the material is faulty?</p>
<p>– Kestrellius</p>
<p>P.S.: I don’t know if you’ll like the first video I linked by that guy, but you’ll definitely like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjM8woqBOX8">this one</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>40:03 Mailbag: Fake Rivers in Cities: Skylines</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>sup Diecastermans:</p>
<p>I was recently disappointed by Cities: Skylines.  Well, maybe by one of their level designers.  I love the game, and I recently started my yearly-ish city building project, selecting a map that had a lovely canyon in which I hoped to build a hydroelectric dam.  This dam wasn’t going to win any awards for highest dam in the game, but it was good enough.  I built up my population, saved my… sky-moleons?… and built the dam.  It wasn’t the best dam, but it was ours.</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p></p>
<blockquote><p>That, and it was going to double my electricity production.</p>
<p>But it was all a lie.</p>
<p>Turns out, the lovely canyon was just a sculpture.  The riverbed at its bottom was nothing but a carved sluice.  As soon as the river broke its bank, filling stopped for good.  I even tried to augment the flow of the river by diverting my (mostly-filtered) sewage into it.</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p></p>
<blockquote><p>No good.  In fact, the flow arrows showed (and you can see from the… smear…) that the fluid I was pumping into the basin was actually flowing up river, presumably draining off the edge of the map after the Fog claims our vision.</p>
<p>I’ve always enjoyed the way Cities: Skylines simulates “realistic” water flow and lets you build dams based on “actual” hydrostatic pressure, but the map design on this one foiled the system and left me sad.  I wound up blowing up the dam and retiring the city shortly thereafter.  What games or circumstances have left you similarly disappointed?</p>

<p><strong>47:14 Mailbag: Bioware’s fate</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>There was a recent interview with (now) ex-bioware writer Drew Karpyshyn where he lamented that the studio became more corporate as it got larger, which affected the game design. </p>
<p>How does this fit into your thoughts on their games and acquisition by EA? </p>

Duoae</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>57:47 Mailbag: Machine Learning and Game Install Sizes</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>In the past both of you have spoken about ballooning game install sizes and procedurally generated content. Now it seems like there’s more tech on the horizon for reducing not only install size but also development work. </p>
<p>On the one hand, a team at microsoft are working with using machine learning to up-res textures on-the-fly. On the other, Dreams (from Media Molecule) uses some sort of real-time renderer that utilises the async compute abilities of the APU in the playstations. Both of these techniques mean small install sizes and interesting optimisations, and could be an interesting addition to procedural generation. </p>
<p>Further to this we already have the nascent ray-tracing technology…. i think the next few years will be really interesting. </p>
<p>What do you think? </p>

      <itunes:summary>We got so many questions this week that we had to dedicate the entire episode to them. Well, we spent a few minutes of the latest Satisfactory update. But other than that, this episode is all mailbag. I hope you’re happy, The Internet. 

Also, this episode is also available on YouTube, if that’s your jam.

11:49 Mailbag: Tomb Raider

Dear diecast (although its mostly for Shamus, sorry Paul)
Since you’ve been hurting for mailbag questions, I’ll try to give you some. I recently sank my teeth in the tomb raider rereboot (2013, rise and shadow of the tomb raider). I remember Shamus being really positive about tomb raider 2013 but less so about rise of the tomb raider, and disliking shadow (if i interpreted his blog correctly). My question is: does Shamus dislike the changes the of the latest TR games, or did the rebooted TR series not sit well over time? What i mean is, would Shamus still be blown away by TR 2013 if it came out today, or was it just impressive in 2013. Should Shamus still enjoy enjoy replaying TR 2013 now?
With kind regards,
Chiris
17:36 Mailbag: Overpowered in a Good Way

Dear Diecast,
You recently praised Risk of Rain 2 for the fact that it allows the player to stack up bonuses without limit and become totally overpowered in a way most games don’t permit. Usually becoming overpowered is boring for the same reason that turning on god mode is boring, but every now and then I find a game like Noita or Slay The Spire where becoming way more powerful than the enemies somehow makes it fun instead of tedious to spend fifteen minutes effortlessly stomping everything. What do you think is the magic spark that makes this difference?

25:51 Mailbag: The Forums

Dear Diecast Shamus, (sorry Paul!)
Any update on whether the forums are coming back? If they aren’t coming back, is there any chance of making a data dump of the archives available? I’ve had times where I’ve wanted to refer back to some previous forum discussions since they’ve been down.
—
Relatedly, are there any changes that could be make to the blog to facilitate longer-term discussion? It seems blog discussions currently have a very short shelf-life: once a post is no longer the top post discussion mostly dies.
And when revisiting a comment section, it’s hard to find the new comments posted since I last visited; and to see if anyone has replied to anything I’ve said.
I know this probably means a terrible trip to the wonderful world of WordPress plugins, but if any of these could be addressed – email notifications, or a quick way of seeing new comments – I think it’d help the blog as a platform for discussion.

26:50 Mailbag: Geforce Now

Dear Diecast,
I’ve been watching release of Geforce Now with interest but it seems that the service is faltering somwhat… given that publishers are removing or withholding their games from the service. However, I’m a bit confused as to why this is an issue or why there are even “compatible” games for this service.
Geforce Now appears to effectively be a virtualised OS instance. I’ve checked several EULAs from various publishers and none of them prohibit the use of games on a virtual machine. They prohibit third party software that alters the game experience (mods/hacks/bots), reselling the software, etc. So, on what basis is this “removal” even taking place under? Why does NVidia even need to obtain permission from the publishers to run the games?
Maybe you have some insight into this or maybe it’ll spark a debate in the comments.
All the best,
Duoae
33:56 Mailbag: Heresy!

Dear Diecast,
Not too long ago, I encountered this video. It makes the argument that Half-Life 2 is a bad sequel (though not necessarily a bad game). Now I’ve never properly played any of the Half-Life games (my attempt to play the series began and ended with 1, where my awful sense o…</itunes:summary>

<p><strong>40:56 Mailbag: Preventing the Collapse of Civilization</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Twenty Sided Die That’s Been Cast,</p>
<p>I’ve come across a conference talk by Jon Blow where he discusses the impact of modern day programming languages and high level tools on software quality, and what it means for our society as a whole. It’s an hour long talk, so here’s the keynotes version:</p>
<p>Today, software is ubiquitous in everyday life. At the same time, the convenience of modern day coding tools has made the need for low level software engineers go down. According to Jon Blow, this makes for a potentially dangerous situation where the number of people who really know how software works underneath the hood is decreasing, while our dependence on software is increasing. He compares this dynamic to how ancient civilizations used to rely on inventions and technology too few people understood, eventually leading to unsustainability and collapse.</p>
<p>The talk is actually titled “Preventing the collapse of civilization”. Here’s the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW-SOdj4Kkk</p>
<p>I know I’ve left a ton of stuff out, but I’d still love to hear your thoughts on this.</p>
<p>All the best and stay awesome,<br>

<p>Here is the video in question:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>I don’t agree with all of his conclusions / dire predictions, but it’s a fantastic talk. And even though I’m not as pessimistic as Blow, he makes a lot of good points.</p>
<p><strong>57:37 Mailbag: JFO vs. Mass Effect</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Artists Currently Known as The Diecast,</p>
<p>I was very happy to hear Shamus had enjoyed Jedi: Fallen Order. I’ve watched Joseph Anderson stream the game, and I couldn’t help but notice the plot similarities it had to the original Mass Effect. Ancient ruins of a long-extinct alien civilization? Check. Chasing down a macguffin across numerous planets? Check. A cool ship with a galaxy map and crew members you can get to know? Check! An encounter with a vision/hologram of a member of the aforementioned ancient species towards the end? Check-a-roo!</p>
<p>And it’s not just story structure stuff like that, either. The way the Zepho are presented, what their ruins look like, I thought it all emanated very distinct ME1/Prothean vibes. I’d love to know if you had similar observations, and whether or not it could have influenced your overall impression of the game.</p>

<p><strong>1:03:41 Mailbag: Script Book</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Hey, did you guys know that you can now buy a script book for Insomniac’s Sony’s Marvel’s Spider-Man?  I’m not sure what it contains beyond the script for the cutscenes, but there is allegedly at least some content related to the process of writing for a AAA video game.</p>

<p>I can’t believe this happened just as I completed an article speculating on changes in the script. (I finished the script yesterday, and the book officially releases tomorrow.) I suppose someone will buy it and we’ll find out if I was completely prescient / misguided.</p>
<p><strong>1:08:31 Mailbag: Trying different builds.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hey, Young Spooner,<br>
have you ever run into that problem where you start playing a RPG, maybe get through the tutorial and a few early battles, decide your character/build isn’t interesting, go back and repeat the previous steps a few times, and when you finally have an interesting character, you’re tired and sick of the game, so you turn it off and never touch it again?</p>
<p>If you were a game developer, what could you add to/change about your game to avoid this sort of “reroll burnout”?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Mikko</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the first question in a long time that has me stumped.</p>

<p>You’ve been saying for decades that people who pirate are not potential costumers who wouldn’t buy the game anyway, but it seems like they actually are. You’re still right on the front that fighting piracy is a self-defeating move, though. This indie uploaded his game on piratebay DRM-free and saw a considerable uptick on his actual sales, 400%.</p>

<p>1. You are a good writer.<br>
2. You have created assets when you worked at activeworlds, you have released Good Robot on steam, you have created some proc-gen demos. In short, you understand how much work it is too realize a gameworld and how your choices as a writer will affect the work the modelers, the animators etc. have to do.</p>

You’ve been saying for decades that people who pirate are not potential costumers who wouldn’t buy the game anyway, but it seems like they actually are. You’re still right on the front that fighting piracy is a self-defeating move, though. This indie uploaded his game on piratebay DRM-free and saw a considerable uptick on his actual sales, 400%.
Do you have any thoughts on this phenomenon? You could use it as a talking point on your next DieCast.
Cheers from your Brazilian Fan, RCN, AKA, OlamTheBard.
1:00:17 Mailbag: Why don’t you write a game [Shamus]?

So Shamus, have you considered writing an application letter to one of your favourite game studio’s? You bring unique qualities to the table.
1. You are a good writer.
2. You have created assets when you worked at activeworlds, you have released Good Robot on steam, you have created some proc-gen demos. In short, you understand how much work it is too realize a gameworld and how your choices as a writer will affect …</itunes:summary>

<strong>00:00 Game of Thrones, Marvel, and Star Wars all Ended Last Year</strong></p>
<p>The other thing that changed after <em>Avengers Endgame</em> is I sorta lost interest in the theater. It’s expensive, I have to plan my day around showtimes, I can’t pause, the only food is terrible and massively overpriced. The audio is usually way too high and massively bass boosted so that explosions are painful and dialog can be hard to parse. I can’t turn on subtitles if a character mumbles too much. I can’t rewind if I miss a line of dialog. The seats aren’t as nice as the one I have at home, I’m in a room full of strangers, and sometimes I end up with my view obscured by tall people. </p>
<p>The “big screen experience” is nice, but I don’t think it’s nice enough to offset all those other downsides. I went to the theater for Marvel movies because I couldn’t wait to see them and I didn’t want to spend six months dodging conversations to avoid spoilers. But now I just don’t care that much. </p>
<p>This is the kind of shift you’d expect to happen over time, but for me it was like someone flipped a switch as I exited the theater after Endgame. I can’t imagine anything that would make me go back.</p>

I don’t know what to call them and it’s bothering me.  Is there a commonly agreed upon name for the genre?  I need to know how to tag them in my games library.  I’m calling them “Other” at the moment it looks a little pathetic.  (See attached screenshot.)  Help!</p>

<p><strong>1:06:41 Mailbag: CP2077 Delay</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi!</p>
<p>You’ve probably already heard about another CP2077 delay (is it a fourth delay? Not sure). Do either of you have a bad feeling about the game or you’re confident that CD Projekt Red will prevail with the style? After reading about GlassDoor leaks from former members, and pondering on the long development cycle (from 2012 no less) with three or so restarts, I can’t help but expect Frankenstein of a game, not unlike Thi4f. And that’s a very painful comparison for me. And I can’t really find examples of games with 8 years of development, that turned out good and/or playable (Duke Nukem Forever, STALKER, Mass Effect Andromeda and such).</p>
<p>Best regards, DeadlyDark</p></blockquote>

Dear Shamus and Paul,
what are your opinions on Game Developers Essentials Lessons Book, or GDELB for short? If you’re not aware, GDELB is a series (well, it’s 2 videos at the moment, but the creator has confirmed a third one is in the works) that playfully pokes fun at certain mannerisms and habits exhibited by video game essayists such as Joseph Anderson, Mark Brown, and Downward Thrust. They’re crammed full of references, so they can be hard to follow, but it’s amazing to watch if you’re familiar with the source material.

Here is the first episode of GDELB.

44:30 Shake Hands with Beef

Hi Diecast,
I just learned about beef, a new gamedev-oriented language developed by one of the co-founders of PopCap games. (HackerNews discussion thread)
I don’t do much programming anymore, but I was wondering what you think about how this compares to Jai?

Shamus always mentions watching GamesDoneQuick each time it’s on. Usually I don’t have time to really get invested in the events due to time differences and schedule. This year is different and I’ve been trying to watch the speedruns that really interest me like the Fallout Anthology run, Ocarina of Time (NoSource) Manifold Garden and GTA:San Andreas.

<p>Like I said on the show, recent technological advances are making VR headsets better instead of cheaper. The evolution of the smartphone suggests that we should eventually reach a point where the hardware starts coming down in price. Then again, every technology is a little different because the price floor is shaped by both the number of consumers and the turnover rate.  </p>

The San Andreas run has some good moments in it, but due to the nature of the game they’re pretty spaced out and there’s a lot of time spent just playing the game. It lasts 4.5 hours and the runner has to spend a lot of time doing these headache-inducing camera jerks to keep the streets clear of traffic. Much like Rockstar games themselves, this run is an amazing showcase of skill and dedication, but it’s also low on thrills. </p>

39:58 Mailbag: Should games be fun?

Dear Diecast,
One of the long-standing questions about our hobby that I occasionally wrestle with is: should games be fun?
Some people would go as far as to say that a game which makes no effort to be fun isn’t a game by definition. I would counter that by pointing to Survival Horror, one of our most venerable genres, which has built itself on a foundation not of fun, but fear. There are other titles such as the Dark Souls series, Team Ico’s output and certain entries from the Zelda franchise which I’ve found striking for their use of melancholy as the dominant colour in their emotional palette.
I’m not trying to score points against the ‘games should be fun’ camp – I love fun games as much as everyone else.

<p>Show notes:<br>
<strong>00:00 Happy New Year</strong></p>
<p>I played games for the new year. I started playing Saints Row 3 at 11:30pm. The next time I looked at the clock it was 12:20. In my defense, I’ve done quite a few of these things by now. This was the fifth time in my life I’ve watched the decade roll over, and it’s not as special as it used to be.</p>
<p><strong>02:21 Shamus is “playing” the guitar.</strong></p>
<p>In this segment I claimed that it doesn’t say “Squier” on my guitar. This is incorrect. It says so in GREAT BIG LETTERS on the head. For bonus incompetence, the guitar was right beside me when I recorded this. If I’d just moved my eyes a few degrees to the right, I’d have been looking at the object in question rather than relying on my faulty memory.</p>
<p>So far my playing style sounds like this:</p>
<p><em>Passable strumming a D chord » Awkward Pause » Shaky strumming a C chord » Awkward Pause » Passable strumming a G chord » Awkward Pause » Mangled D chord » Muttered cursing</em></p>
<p>But who cares? It’s fun!</p>
<p><strong>05:52 Paul is playing Rimworld with his Wife</strong></p>
<p><strong>14:37 Shamus is playing Saints Row: The Third</strong></p>
<p>Such an excellent game. It’s a shame the series died with its developer. I suppose it’s possible the rights could make it into the hands of someone new, but there’s no reason to expect that a new team would nail this particular feel. Likely as not we’d end up with something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crackdown_3">Crackdown 3</a>, and nobody needs that. There are enough broken hearts out there already. </p>

Show notes:
00:00 Happy New Year

I played games for the new year. I started playing Saints Row 3 at 11:30pm. The next time I looked at the clock it was 12:20. In my defense, I’ve done quite a few of these things by now. This was the fifth time in my life I’ve watched the decade roll over, and it’s not as special as it used to be.

02:21 Shamus is “playing” the guitar.

In this segment I claimed that it doesn’t say “Squier” on my guitar. This is incorrect. It says so in GREAT BIG LETTERS on the head. For bonus incompetence, the guitar was right beside me when I recorded this. If I’d just moved my eyes a few degrees to the right, I’d have been looking at the object in question rather than relying on my faulty memory.

So far my playing style sounds like this:

Passable strumming a D chord » Awkward Pause » Shaky strumming a C chord » Awkward Pause » Passable strumming a G chord » Awkward Pause » Mangled D chord » Muttered cursing

But who cares? It’s fun!

05:52 Paul is playing Rimworld with his Wife

14:37 Shamus is playing Saints Row: The Third

Such an excellent game. It’s a shame the series died with its developer. I suppose it’s possible the rights could make it into the hands of someone new, but there’s no reason to expect that a new team would nail this particular feel. Likely as not we’d end up with something like Crackdown 3, and nobody needs that. There are enough broken hearts out there already.

<p><strong>01:14 The Witcher Netflix Series</strong></p>
<p>On the podcast I mentioned that the show had several distracting anachronisms. I mentioned the “Off the grid” line. The other major one is Jaskier’s music, which are incredibly, inescapably modern in their construction. They’re essentially pop songs played on old instruments.</p>
<p>Now, this is a fictional world and there’s no reason their music theory couldn’t be a little more complex than the music theory we had in medieval times. This isn’t a plot hole. It’s just distracting. It’s having someone say “Chill out, dude.” There’s no reason that couldn’t be a phrase in their world, but it still sounds off to a modern viewer.</p>
<p>Still, there’s no escaping the fact that this anachronism makes the songs more fun to listen to, and sticking to period-appropriate music would make the songs tedious to most people. </p>
<p>It’s a perfectly understandable creative decision, but it still launches me out of the experience whenever Jaskier starts singing. </p>
<p>Also: I guess this is the Dandelion character from the game? I like him better here. </p>
<p><strong>18:31 Mailbag: Website Peeves</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>If I had to list them, my number three worst peeves of modern(?) websites are:<br>
1. Websites that continually resize/resort/whatever so the links can jump around causing you to misclick.<br>
2. Websites that allow you to start an action (such as replying to a post or placing an order), but then require you to login to complete that action, but then don’t return you to where you were after you login.<br>

<p>In this segment I said, “If you’re too stupid to realize that leaving a comment requires cookies…”. </p>
<p>This makes it sound like I’m looking down at people who aren’t tech savvy. That’s a terrible way of stating things because that’s <strong>not</strong> what I was trying to say! I was trying to aim contempt at people who don’t understand how technology works, but who <strong>get offended anyway</strong>. Like, this website uses cookies so you can edit your comments. Without cookies, you’re a new person every time you reload the page and the website has no way of confirming that you’re the person who left a comment ten seconds ago. My problem is with people who get angry at a site using cookies who also don’t understand what cookies are for and how they work. Yes, cookies have been used to do all sorts of sketchy privacy-invading crap, but they also have perfectly legitimate uses. I just get annoyed at busybodies who don’t know the difference and think that sites shouldn’t ever be <strong>allowed</strong> to use cookies. </p>
<p>I’m not totally sure how cookies work on my site because I’m using WordPress with a handful of third-party plugins, and those systems were made by other people. I do know that it doesn’t create any long-term data on anyone. (You can’t create an account.) And I don’t ever share anything with anyone. (Not like anyone would offer me money for a list of IP addresses and unconfirmed emails, but even if they did I’d refuse, because ick.) But then we have YouTube embeds on this site, and who knows what those things collect on behalf of Google.</p>
<p><strong>23:08 Mailbag: Paying for Basic Features</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>News from this last week came to my eyes indicating that the latest Call of Duty game (published by Activision) doesn’t include a kill/death ratio in the in-game (match) interface. However, they have now released a $20 cosmetic accessories pack that includes a watch which shows kills and deaths.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is Activision and we know they’re scummy and this is a particularly scummy move but I wondered: If Activision paid you retirement money for the Good Robot franchise and you sold it to them, What feature would they put behind a paywall? (The obvious one would be the hats but I was thinking about something more obscure… like seeing which level you’re on.)</p>

<p><strong>25:57 Mailbag: Pseudoku Update?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Shamus,</p>
<p>I remember you working on your game Pseudoku quite a while ago, but it was stalled due to bureaucratic reasons. I think there was maybe one or two small mentions since then, but it’s been pretty quiet.</p>
<p>Anyways a lot has happened since, with different projects and learning unity and such. What is the current state of the game? It looked really interesting. I remember enjoying the demo a whole bunch, especially the music. Is it still on the back-burner, or has it gone the way of the HL3?</p>
<p>– Zach</p></blockquote>
<p>If you’re curious, Paul has <a href="http://peripheralarbor.com/pseudoku052.zip">a mirror of the original Pseudoku demo</a>.</p>
<p><strong>27:41 Mailbag: Good Mechanics in Unpopular Games?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Do you ever look back at a game you liked/loved and which everyone else hated and then see many of the same mechanics ported to games which have gone on to be liked/loved by everyone else?</p>
<p>I remember when Prince of Persia (2008) was released – many people derided it for its simplistic platforming (for which they felt they provided no input), the ease of the game (since you never “died” you just respawned at the last safe solid ground/platform) and terrible combat. </p>
<p>Now, I can’t fault them for hating the combat, it really was a chore and a very weird system. However, the platforming had as much control as that provided by Jedi: Fallen Order and the “fall off of platform and immediate save” mechanic was used in multiple games since then (Bioshock: Infinite and Fallen Order come to mind mostly). </p>
<p>IMO, 2008 came closest to repeating the magical interation between the story/characters and the player of The Sands of Time. I really wish a sequel had been made. I fear that the series is basically dead at this point since it can’t be turned into a collectathon open world like Assassin’s Creed or Watch Dogs by Ubisoft…. (dear god, please don’t let Ubisoft do that!)</p>
<p>Do you have any games that you really enjoyed whose mechanics were disliked at the time but then had games which were popular reuse them without issue?</p>
<p>All the best (and Merry Christmas – if this is on that show :) ),<br>

<p><strong>35:04 Mailbag: Halo</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Given your love of Sci-Fi, are you aware of Halo’s story, and if so what do you think of it? </p>
<p>It’s deeper than you’d expect from Halo’s shooter reputation.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Thomas</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>42:38 Mailbag: Ruins as a setting </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear spatial translators of semi-regular hand-held polyhedral solids with numerically-encoded facets:</p>
<p>A few months back, I ran across a post discussing the often-overlooked fact that the very structure of Dungeons &amp; Dragons implies a fallen world, one in which civilization has collapsed and the survivors are attempting to re-build among the wreckage. It’s even explicit, in that successive rule-sets advance the narrative of the world you’re dropped into, along a societal curve one might expect given the remnants of the populous slowly reclaiming the world around them — an endless wilderness with monsters in one edition gives way to villages and outposts in the next, and cities after that.</p>
<p>http://www.brainleakage.com/home/the-implied-apocalypse-of-dungeons-dragons </p>
<p>But this tendency is everywhere in storytelling, not merely D&amp;D (think of Rey, in The Force Awakens, scavenging in what remains of the Empire’s ships), and I’ve seen it suggested that perhaps this is a remnant of medieval thinking, with the dominant storytelling tropes originating from societies that had developed among the ruins of ancient Rome.</p>
<p>I was wondering what your thoughts were on how this same tendency has guided the ideas we expect from games, too, and what the implications of that are for story and worldbuilding. I can’t imagine Skyrim, for example, without the Dwemer ruins, while Half-Life 2 has us playing through the events of the collapse itself. This sort of deep history seems almost critical to establishing a detailed setting that feels old and lived-in, and yet the emphasis on collapse and rebuild feels constraining as well.</p>
<p>Yours in nerdiness,<br>
Ryan</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>56:33 Mailbag: Youtube 60fps</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Shamus Youtube vids are 1080p but not 60fps.  Explain?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<span id="more-48743"></span><strong>00:00 The Game Awards</strong></p>
<p>Here is the archived livestream, if you like watching pre-recorded award shows.</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>18:08 Hacking YouTube</strong></p>
<p>I used a bad hypothetical example in this section. I talked about someone making a 30 minute documentary on Duke Nukem, but using 5 seconds of a copyrighted song as a punchline / gag. So then the record label copyright claims the video and gets 100% of the revenue because they own 0.27% of the audio.</p>
<p>Looking back, I think this is a bad example because using copyrighted stuff for a joke might not be covered under fair use. Granted, the MORAL thing is that the record label gets nothing because this “infringement” did them no harm and did nothing to weaken their IP. But according to the law, the label might have a case.</p>
<p>At any rate, a much cleaner example would be:</p>
<p>As part of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nryFmUjtwEY">musical instruction video</a>, I play 10 seconds of a popular song. I use my own performance on a single instrument. I only reproduce a section of the song and not the whole thing. This usage is entirely for educational purposes.</p>
<p>In this case, I would be 100% in the right. This usage is absolutely covered under fair use. In fact, <strong>this example is why fair use exists.</strong> This use is both legal and moral. And yet YouTube’s disgusting system would automatically rob me of my few dollars of income and hand it off to a giant corporation who did nothing to produce the work in question.</p>
<p>Like I said on the show: This is a fundamentally immoral and corrupt system. It’s a system of automated <strong>theft</strong>, where the rich and powerful take from the small and powerless. YouTube is complicit in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4AeoAWGJBw">this crime</a>.</p>
<p>So yeah. Screw this sick Kafkaesque system.</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>24:35 System Shock Demo</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/systemshock/comments/ea30wf/reloading_the_magnum_in_the_demo/">I couldn’t figure out how to put the bullets in the gun</a>, which is a hilarious problem to have in a shooter.</p>
<p><strong>36:10 Mailbag: Replay ONE game for the first time?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear dī-kast</p>
<p>Whether it’s a linear narrative that would be repetitive to replay, a puzzle game that wouldn’t be satisfying now that you remember all the solutions, or a survival game where most of the progression is about learning the game’s systems, some games are only satisfying to play once. if you could take a magic pill that would erase all your memory of one videogame so that you could play it again completely fresh, which game would you choose and why?</p>
<p>Ninety-Three</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>40:41 Mailbag: Big Cities</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>I was looking through my old folders of random assorted games and whatnot and stumbled upon a directory of games from the BigTown contest, where people were challenged to make a game set in as big a city as possible. This made me think of big cities in various games and it struck me that most cities and towns tend to be very small.</p>
<p>What are your favourite big(-ish) cities and towns in games, if any?</p>

<p><strong>1:01:25 Mailbag: EGS Revisited.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Now that some of the most controversial Epic exclusives have been released for the Dirty-Commie-Mutant-Traitors who use that platform, specifically Mechwarrior 5 and Phoenix Point (As well as a Paranoia game, thus the epithets), have the arguments about the platform changed at all?</p>
<p>As a fellow Filthy-Traitorous-Mutated-Commie myself (Don’t tell Friend Computer, had to have Satisfactory while it was one sale, grabbed P-Point at the same time), my personal experience has been somewhat mixed. Satisfactory hasn’t had any issues, but the lack of news-feed has proven detrimental to Phoenix Point. I noticed an issue after it had said it had updated, and I realized there wasn’t any way that I could find to see the patch-notes in the Epic Launcher/Store. (Satisfactory solves this by having them in-game)</p>
<p>There was also some issues with the save-system, with the epic cloud saves constantly asking which save you wanted to use, as well as causing some save files to be stored in the wrong place or just losing them, because Ironman mode wasn’t hard enough, you need to play in a single sitting or not at all.</p>
<p>On the plus side, when looking on the unofficial forum that explained where to find where epic had hidden the saves, I noticed a thread which mentioned that people have already started modding the game, so the lack of steam workshop isn’t completely killing the mod scene, as many had feared it might.</p>
<p>TLDR: Have your thoughts on the EGS changed at all, now that it’s not just the Satisfactory launcher?</p>

Show notes:
00:00 The Game Awards

Here is the archived livestream, if you like watching pre-recorded award shows.




18:08 Hacking YouTube

I used a bad hypothetical example in this section. I talked about someone making a 30 minute documentary on Duke Nukem, but using 5 seconds of a copyrighted song as a punchline / gag. So then the record label copyright claims the video and gets 100% of the revenue because they own 0.27% of the audio.

Looking back, I think this is a bad example because using copyrighted stuff for a joke might not be covered under fair use. Granted, the MORAL thing is that the record label gets nothing because this “infringement” did them no harm and did nothing to weaken their IP. But according to the law, the label might have a case.

At any rate, a much cleaner example would be:

As part of a musical instruction video, I play 10 seconds of a popular song. I use my own performance on a single instrument. I only reproduce a section of the song and not the whole thing. This usage is entirely for educational purposes.

In this case, I would be 100% in the right. This usage is absolutely covered under fair use. In fact, this example is why fair use exists. This use is both legal and moral. And yet YouTube’s disgusting system would automatically rob me of my few dollars of income and hand it off to a giant corporation who did nothing to produce the work in question.

Like I said on the show: This is a fundamentally immoral and corrupt system. It’s a system of automated theft, where the rich and powerful take from the small and powerless. YouTube is complicit in this crime.

So yeah. Screw this sick Kafkaesque system.




24:35 System Shock Demo

I couldn’t figure out how to put the bullets in the gun, which is a hilarious problem to have in a shooter.

36:10 Mailbag: Replay ONE game for the first time?

Dear dī-kast
Whether it’s a linear narrative that would be repetitive to replay, a puzzle game that wouldn’t be satisfying now that you remember all the solutions, or a survival game where most of the progression is about learning the game’s systems, some games are only satisfying to play once. if you could take a magic pill that would erase all your memory of one videogame so that you could play it again completely fresh, which game would you choose and why?
Ninety-Three
40:41 Mailbag: Big Cities

Dear Diecast,
I was looking through my old folders of random assorted games and whatnot and stumbled upon a directory of games from the BigTown contest, where people were challenged to make a game set in as big a city as possible. This made me think of big cities in various games and it struck me that most cities and towns tend to be very small.
What are your favourite big(-ish) cities and towns in games, if any?
Vale,
-Tim



45:14 Mailbag: The End of Windows 7

Dear Diecast
Since the release of Windows 10, I have stayed happily faithful to my trusty Windows 7, never seeing a legitimate need to change. It has proven stable, streamlined and capable of running all the programmes I need, including my extensive library of video games, old an new. By contrast, the forced updates, data harvesting, lack of user control and general operating-system-as-service ethos of Windows 10 is unsettlingly Orwellian.

<p>Okay, Disney products aren’t deep, challenging, or thought-provoking entertainment. It’s broad and safe and carefully engineered to be inoffensive to the general population. But if you want a couple of hours where it stops hurting inside, then Disney is a pretty safe bet, box-office wise.</p>

Searching the archives, though, I found surprisingly few articles/Diecast references to it, considering how much you loved the game. Am I going crazy here? Is there stuff missing from archive or at least not showing up in the search for some reason, or did you actually never talk about Prey that much? If not, why not?</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,<br>
How would you go about crafting a more convincing Lara Croft/Jason Brody (Far Cry 3) style character arc in a video game? You know, where the player character goes from a crying mess to a one person army through the course of the game as you level up and gain abilities. The problem always seems to me that the pacing required to pull it off would be to slow for a mainstream action game; can’t spend to much time in the first part of the arc because the player will want to be shooting more things at this point. But maybe this idea could work better as more of a straight up stealth game? Well those are my thoughts and I’m curious to hear yours.</p>

<p><strong>00:00 Building a sub $300 “Gaming” PC</strong></p>
<p></p><br>
<p></p>
<p><strong>05:13 Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</strong></p>
<p>Just finished my second playthrough. Short review: Combat is fantastic. Getting around and general level flow is horrendous and frustrating. (The constant one-way gates mixed with the sparse save points and lack of fast travel really make the whole “collection and exploration” part of the game a chore.)</p>
<p><strong>14:56 RIP Steam Controller, General controller discussion</strong></p>
<p><strong>26:54 Unlock the King</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172510/Unlock_The_King/">What an interesting idea for a game</a>, although the first 50 puzzles are a bit toothless. It’s nice, gentle fun.</p>
<p><strong>29:18 Running Cat 6 Through the Attic</strong></p>
<p>It always seems like it should be straightforward. It never is.</p>
<p><strong>33:24 Mailbag: Toxicity of Internet Discourse</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Shamus –<br>
  You’ve said before that the a problem with internet arguments is that civil discussions can easily get derailed by a tiny minority of vocal, rude participants that poison the conversation by changing the tone. Is that a fair summary of your opinion?</p>
<p>I read in the news a while ago that agents of a foreign government had made a coordinated effort to do exactly that. They posed as normal Americans online and they injected hostility and extremism into the discourse. Do you see a connection between this news and your personal observations?</p>
<p>I think I remember reading about this in several different places but, for reference, here’s one example of the news I’m talking about: https://medium.com/s/story/the-trolls-within-how-russian-information-operations-infiltrated-online-communities-691fb969b9e4<br>
  – DTor</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>35:52 Mailbag: Mailing Lists</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Shamus and Paul,</p>
<p>I’ve been following videos on YT channel, and noticed that while you suggest subscribing (way ahead of you!:), you also actually explained reasoning behind it (algorithm hacking).</p>
<p>Lately several other youtube creators I follow suggested something different: subscribing to their mailing list.</p>
<p>Most notable example with explaination is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIssymQvrbU">CGP Grey</a> (which I know you follow too): </p>
<p>And I find it interesting that subscribing in that fashion at some expense of doing it via youtube system (surely some people won’t want to get notification twice) seem to conflict with algo-gaming rationale.</p>
<p>I’ve been following youtube via notification emails exclusively for years, and can attest that it’s not great at delivering these, as I’m<br>
sure you know too (pretty sure it happened a few times for me with Bob Case’s already rare-gem videos). So wonder about what you guys think on the topic?</p>
<p>Cheers, Mike.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>11:54 Mailbag: Procgen Stealth</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Shamus and Paul:</p>
<p>Please can you wang on about the procedurally generated stealth game Shadows of Doubt:</p>
<p>https://store.steampowered.com/app/986130/Shadows_of_Doubt/<br>
https://colepowered.com/</p>
<p>(I’m not involved in this game, I’d just like to hear your thoughts)</p>
<p>Ross</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>47:07 Mailbag: Single-Save games</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi!</p>
<p>A couple of loosely related questions</p>
<p>1. No idea if you ever played or will play- Vampyr or not, but I hope the question will make sense nonetheless. In short, it’s an RPG (a RPG?) where you play as a british doctor in post-WW1 London who recently became a vampire (a vampyr?) and trying to survive.</p>
<p>So, one of the ideas of this game, is that doesn’t allow you to have multiple saves during the playthrough. And you can’t manually save — it’s all autosaves. Just like Alpha Protocol, just without time restriction on dialogue choices. Another idea — one of the ways to gain additional XP is to drink an NPC’s blood (and killing them in the process), if you desire. To make person’s blood more… potent (I assume) you have to unlock «facts» about the person by either talking to this person, talking to other people about this person or doing quests involving this person. Each NPC has a set number facts, that you can look in the menu (this guy has, so far, 3 locked facts, this lady has 2 unlocked facts and 2 locked ones, etc). Now…</p>
<p>I’ve played a couple evenings a couple weeks ago, enjoyed the start of the game a lot. I met a claustrophobic guy and in one of the dialogs you must guess the reason for his condition. I chose poorly and the menu showed that this fact is lost and no longer unclockable. And because of the save system, I can’t reload a save now. I’m almost sure, that the game didn’t tell me beforehand, that I can prevent myself from unlocking facts. I’m planning to play as a pacifist, so missing XP isn’t the issue here, but missing parts of the content is bothering me and prevents me of continuing with the game. I’m almost wanting to restart the game anew.</p>
<p>So… The question for you is this. We all want experiments with the gameplay, to keep things fresh. And I respect the choice of devs to make this save system and see the intent here. But… I don’t think the experiment is a successful one, to be honest. What do you think about this save system, and which save systems you find most interesting yourself?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This email continues in the next section…</p>
<p><strong>54:14 Mailbag: Standardized Controls</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>2. In a recent diecast, in the question about game classics, you noted, that games that you can name have bad controls. Or rather non-standardized controls. But is it a bad thing per se? Two years ago I played enchanced edition of System Shock, the one that had mouse look. And yeah, having a mouse look is cool. And the game is great (probably one of the best games I played in recent years). But the most satisfying part of the game for me was the weapon’s reload process. You disengage the mouse look quickly move the mouse cursor to the bottom left corner, switch tabs, select your ammo, move it to the weapon icon, engage the mouse look. Yes its clunky, but in the heat of the moment you feel like you reloaded the weapon yourself (despite it not being done with VR). Now its mostly press R (or X, or square). Or press a button in the exact moment to make it instant if the game fees fancy.</p>
<p>Do you think, that more games should strive to go away from standardized control scheme to enchance the experience in some way? E.g., do old-school Resident Evil’s tank controls, if you feel that it works for your game. Or may be it’s for the better that games are more or less unified with their control scheme? I honestly don’t know.</p>
<p>Best regards, DeadlyDark</p></blockquote>

Just finished my second playthrough. Short review: Combat is fantastic. Getting around and general level flow is horrendous and frustrating. (The constant one-way gates mixed with the sparse save points and lack of fast travel really make the whole “collection and exploration” part of the game a chore.)

14:56 RIP Steam Controller, General controller discussion

26:54 Unlock the King

What an interesting idea for a game, although the first 50 puzzles are a bit toothless. It’s nice, gentle fun.

29:18 Running Cat 6 Through the Attic

It always seems like it should be straightforward. It never is.

33:24 Mailbag: Toxicity of Internet Discourse

Shamus –
  You’ve said before that the a problem with internet arguments is that civil discussions can easily get derailed by a tiny minority of vocal, rude participants that poison the conversation by changing the tone. Is that a fair summary of your opinion?
I read in the news a while ago that agents of a foreign government had made a coordinated effort to do exactly that. They posed as normal Americans online and they injected hostility and extremism into the discourse. Do you see a connection between this news and your personal observations?
I think I remember reading about this in several different places but, for reference, here’s one example of the news I’m talking about: https://medium.com/s/story/the-trolls-within-how-russian-information-operations-infiltrated-online-communities-691fb969b9e4

35:52 Mailbag: Mailing Lists

Hi Shamus and Paul,
I’ve been following videos on YT channel, and noticed that while you suggest subscribing (way ahead of you!:), you also actually explained reasoning behind it (algorithm hacking).
Lately several other youtube creators I follow suggested something different: subscribing to their mailing list.
Most notable example with explaination is CGP Grey (which I know you follow too): 
And I find it interesting that subscribing in that fashion at some expense of doing it via youtube system (surely some people won’t want to get notification twice) seem to conflict with algo-gaming rationale.
I’ve been following youtube via notification emails exclusively for years, and can attest that it’s not great at delivering these, as I’m
sure you know too (pretty sure it happened a few times for me with Bob Case’s already rare-gem videos). So wonder about what you guys think on the topic?
Cheers, Mike.

Dear Shamus and Paul:
Please can you wang on about the procedurally generated stealth game Shadows of Doubt:

47:07 Mailbag: Single-Save games

Hi!
A couple of loosely related questions
1. No idea if you ever played or will play- Vampyr or not, but I hope the question will make sense nonetheless. In short, it’s an RPG (a RPG?) where you play as a british doctor in post-WW1 London who recently became a vampire (a vampyr?) and trying to survive.
So, one of the ideas of this game, is that doesn’t allow you to have multiple saves during the playthrough. And you can’t manually save — it’s all autosaves. Just like Alpha Protocol, just without time restriction on dialogue choices. Another idea — one of the ways to gain additional XP is to drink an NPC’s blood (and killing them in the process), if you desire. To make person’s blood more… potent (I assume) you have to un…</itunes:summary>

<p>I have done all the main quests for the three leaders Marshall, Hagar, and Kvasir. All three say that everything is ready for Project Dagger, which is the final mission. However, the in-game journal still says “Help your allies to build Project Dagger”, indicating that everything is <strong>not</strong> ready. There’s no map marker / quest objective. If I get in the tank and drive to the enemy base, I get dialog suggesting that the project is not ready, and then get a scripted insta-kill death from the door defenses.</p>
<p>Changing quests doesn’t help. Talking to the leaders doesn’t do anything. Dying doesn’t fix it. Restarting the game doesn’t help. Doing other quests doesn’t do anything.

<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Any thoughts on the new Half-Life Alyx game announcement? One thing that bugged me about the constant delays is the risk that voice actors may have their voices change, pass away (as Robert Guillame and Robert Culp did), or otherwise be unavailable. Sure enough, Merle Dandridge is no longer voicing Alyx Vance in the game, which might be justifiable as its a teenage Alyx and Merle is now 44, but makes me wonder if that would still be the case were they ever to release Half-Life 3.</p></blockquote>

Dear Diecast,
I was reading Programming Vexations part 9 and got to thinking. In the movies there are classics that are considered to be must-watch films like The Lord of the Rings, The Lion King, Citizen Kane, and so on.
Are there older games (let’s say at least 15 years old) that you would consider to be must-play games?
I’d say something like Super Metroid or Ultima Underworld 2 would be a definite contender.

However, your laziness is compounded by <strong>my</strong> laziness.

<p><strong>00:00 Church Cultures and Funeral Traditions</strong></p>
<p>Hopefully I got through this without offending anyone.</p>
<p>There was one small point that I wanted to make before I got sidetracked talking about impressive buildings, and that’s how movies tend to create the perception of a monoculture. They want to shoot their scenes in the most impressive churches and foreboding graveyards, which means you never get to see the other stuff. I never cared about this because most of the movies I watch are set in my country and I don’t care that they leave out the small churches and modest graveyards. I already know that stuff exists. But now I’m wondering what I’m missing in all those <strong>other</strong> countries. When a movie shows me yet another example of building X in country Y, what sort of details am I missing? How does Hollywood skew our perception of <strong>your</strong> country / region?</p>
<p>Sorry. The funerals I’ve attended lately have made me curious about this sort of thing.</p>
<p>Another fun detail I wanted to put on the show:</p>
<p>Coming home from the funeral parlor, my wife and I were talking about the practice of embalming corpses, placing them in ornate boxes, and burying them in a spot of prime real estate. I told my wife I didn’t care what happened to my body, but I was worried about my website. I told her, “Just have the cheapest funeral you can and take what you would normally spend on the burial and instead renew my domain and web hosting for as long as you can.”</p>
<p>This website is my favorite thing that I’ve ever made, and it would break my heart<span class="snote" title="1">Except not really, because I’d be dead.</span> if it were to lapse to domain squatters a year after I passed.</p>
<p>Anyway. This morbid fit should pass soon and I’ll hopefully get back to normal.</p>
<p><strong>14:51 New Steam Interface</strong></p>
<p>If we rate Steam on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being where it’s been for the last few years and 10 being what I want it to be, then I give the new interface a solid 2. It’s an improvement, but still short of what I’m looking for.</p>

<p><strong>37:55 Pretentious Games</strong></p>
<p><strong>55:55 Mailbag: aRPG games and magic users.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>This may not be your bag but, with the recent reveal of Diablo 4, one of my recurring gaming gripes has reared its ugly head again. Why can’t designers make magic users fun to play? There’s a long history of aRPGs having exciting animations and visual feedback for the players (don’t mention the word “visceral”) when playing more physically-focussed classes but then only really focussing on the particle effects of the spells.</p>
<p>I was watching a lot of the first hand youtube coverage (Game Informer, specifically) and I kept hearing how people found the barbarian and druid classes fun to play but the sorceress was just boring… and, quite frankly, I agree with them. However, it’s only because I can see that a lot of care and effort has gone into making the normal attacks, movement and special animations of those classes really fun and visually interesting – they feel weighty. The sorceress just raises her hands and/or staff and something happens on-screen. This isn’t the first game doing this – it’s basically all of them!</p>
<p>Magic has always required theatrics to make it look interesting – both in stage shows and in cinema/TV series. Gandalf didn’t just wave his hands and say, “You shall not pass!” Doctor strange didn’t just point a finger and stop the water in End Game… Why is this being missed?</p>
<p>Okay, that got a bit long, let me give a tl;dr summary to make it snappy for the podcast:</p>
<p>“With the recent reveal of Diablo 4, one of my recurring gaming gripes has reared its ugly head again. Why can’t designers make magic users fun to play? They spend a lot of time on physical classes and their animations and player feedbacks but then ignore those of the magic users. There’s no theatrics to any of the animations of spellcasters and, moreso than physical-based classes, the magic users need theatrics to sell the effort. Is this something you’ve noticed? Are there types of games where you can see designers are constantly missing something other media excel at and fail to apply those tropes?”</p>
<p>All the best,<br>
Duoae</p></blockquote>
<p>I need to add a nitpick shield: In this section I complained that magic was massively underpowered in Morrrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim. I should note that those first two had spell <strong>crafting</strong>, which would let you break the game by making overpowered spells. That was fun, but it doesn’t solve the central problem that the mechanics didn’t support proper magic-based combat. You could play as intended and tickle people to death with your ineffectual fireballs, or you could craft a broken spell and turn the combat into a joke. You couldn’t just have magic work on the same level as swords / bows.</p>

<p><strong>36:30 Mailbag: Gameplay in games with mature subject matter.  </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>You mentioned recently that you received too much letters and because of that don’t have enough time to talk about anything else on your show. So I decided to write you a letter.</p>
<p>My question concerns the possibilities of telling stories in a videogames primarily through the use of that games’ mechanics. I noticed that many games that are considered to have “mature”* story either:</p>
<p>a) have very minimalist, or almost non-existential gameplay (which isn’t a bad thing, there is no need to create robust mechanic if the game doesn’t need one). Something like Limbo or TellTale’s games;</p>
<p>b) have more robust mechanics, but they are completely separate from the story (like The Last of Us or Bioshock Infinite**, though you tastes may vary; I’m thinking about games in which the story is consider to be good despite the gameplay, not because of it);</p>
<p>However, it’s difficult to find games that are being praised for their “maturity” specifically because of their gameplay. At best, game’s mechanics are not an obstacle.</p>
<p>But I think that gameplay is the “primary language” of games (so to speak) when it comes to communication with players. Expensive cutscenes, sublime soundtrack and so on are great and all, but the core of a game lies in it’s structure of it’s mechanics. Therefore, that should be the main focus when it comes to making a “mature” game – gameplay. Gameplay should enhance the idea of game’s story by creating appropriate impressions through the use of right tools. For example, if the story of a particular game is about the danger of possessing an excessive amount of freedom, then the gameplay itself should allow players to experience that. When the game takes more linear approach, it’s all fall flat, because I don’t feel the story.</p>
<p>So, gameplay should enhance the story. But that’s not what I want to ask you about. I wonder, if it is possible to create a “mature” game that tell it’s story mainly through it’s mechanics (obviously, it would still have some sort of graphic and sonic presentation, but they would enhance the mechanics, not the other way around). Can story be told through gameplay? Could that game achieved world-wide popularity? Or maybe it would be like trying to make a movie by beating yourself in the head with a film projector? Would such thing be a masterpiece or a glorified Excel sheet?</p>
<p>Basically, dose the strength of a videogames’ stories lies in their capability of containing multiple sources of different media or do they have something unique?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Darek</p>
<p>* By “mature games” I mean those that are considered to deal with difficult and (usually) socially important subjects by providing intricate solutions – or by providing the lack of such solutions. You know, something that people describe as… deep.</p>
<p>** I actually consider the stories of this games to be rather mediocre, but that’s beside the point</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>53:45 Mailbag: AI Generated stories  </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,<br>
I don’t know if you guys have ever heard of procedural generation /joking.</p>
<p>Considering there have been a lot of advances made in the fields of NLP (Natural Language Processing) and ML (machine learning), do you think it would be possible to train an AI to generate interesting plots in video games?</p>
<p>I imagine if something like that were possible it would probably be rather generic plot beats overall, i.e. </p>
<p>You’re playing a Knight who is trying to defeat an Evil Wizard to save the Heir to the Throne, and if you happen to lose the AI generates an event to handle your loss. For example Rangerman McArcher, an NPC you met elsewhere, shoots an arrow at EW, who takes off with HttT.<br>
Or do you think it would be too hard to have such a system generate content that’s interesting enough to keep players engaged?<br>

Dear Diecast,

<strong>00:00 Shamus is too busy!</strong></p>
<p>Between the music class, some family difficulties, and some health issues, I’m really running out of hours. This is all temporary. I expect this is going to blow over in the next couple of weeks. Hopefully we don’t end up with another blank spot on the blog like last week.</p>
<p><strong>03:44 Games where you can’t pick up enemy weapons / armor</strong></p>
<p>Issac and I are making an article / video. In this video, I want to have an aside about how funny it is when a game won’t let you pick up weapons and armor from defeated foes. I’d like to have a visual to go along with this. </p>
<p>Here is the question I have for you: Can you think of a game where defeated foes are depicted with clearly visible items that you can’t pick up, even though they would be immediately useful to your character? Like, “Look! There’s a sword on the ground! It’s right next to this guy I just killed, but I’m still using this dagger.” </p>
<p>I  know I’ve played games with this problem in the past, but I’ve been thinking about it for days and I still can’t recall any concrete examples. </p>
<p><strong>05:27 Manifold Garden</strong></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>13:27 Why talking about Hong Kong is bad for Shamus</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that’s ANOTHER reason this blog fell silent last week. After seeing too many pictures of violence and protests, I was kinda having a bit of a freak-out. I think I’m over it now, but we’re probably going to route around this topic for the next couple of weeks. I realize it’s important, but being it’s not worth being anxious, angry, and uncreative for a couple of days. I think the rest of the gaming press can pick up the slack just fine.</p>
<p><strong>23:01 Mailbag: Gaming literacy</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Drs. The Diecast,</p>
<p>An interesting youtube video came across my feed recently (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax7f3JZJHSw) and it reminded me of Shamus’ old video back from 2008 about game literacy and how to introduce people to video games and how to play them, highlighting Prince of Persia as a good example.</p>
<p>Over a decade later how do you (plural) feel about the current state of video games and game literacy, and the barriers to entry? Do you think we’ve gotten any more games that can teach game literacy for people who’ve never played them before?</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Gabriel Mobius</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is the video in question:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw_upFVDIkQ">here is the super-old, janky, and slightly cringe-worthy video</a> Gabriel was referring to. Also, I’ve never revisited <em>Prince of Persia 2008</em>. It was pretty, but it was also sort of shallow and not terribly interesting.</p>
<p><strong>31:13 Sky Islands Minecraft  </strong></p>
<p>This is my first time playing a “floating islands” style modpack. It really is a very different experience. For the record, I’m playing <a href="https://www.feed-the-beast.com/projects/ftb-sky-odyssey">Sky Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p><strong>33:34 Mailbag: Choose-once difficulty</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Why do so many games let you choose your difficulty at the start, but not allow you to change it partway through the game? It’s an obviously unfriendly design choice that keeps coming up and seems like it should be easy to fix. It feels like there has to be some technical restriction or UI reason for it, like how we keep getting two-gun-only FPSs so that console players don’t need a clunky weapon wheel to switch guns.</p>
<p>Ninety-Three</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>40:07 Mailbag: This Dumb Video Edit</strong> </p>
<blockquote><p>Dear diecast,</p>
<p>I’m wondering how Shamus makes his “This Dumb Industry” videos. I remember talking about Adobe Premier years ago on Diecast. Is it still the best for the job?</p>
<p>Yours,<br>
Chris</p></blockquote>
<p>Like I said on the show, Issac and I use CYBERLINK POWER DIRECTOR for editing. That name is a ridiculous mouthfull, so around here it gets shortened to “Cyberdoof”.</p>
<p><strong>44:35 Mailbag: Development platform for small games?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear DieCast,<br>
Been an avid reader of the blog since… I don’t know, a few years at least. Love the long-form analysis and all the past articles about programming. Here’s my question that you probably never heard !, and a little background information after, if you think that’s relevant (let’s keep it short…) :<br>
For a guy that has a little bit of time each week (long commute), eager to learn, good at picking up software rapidly, and an interest in light programming currently (lots of VBA, dipped my toes in Python, could see myself trying something more elaborate), what software/language/combination would you recommend to try to developp small-ish games, and eventually the relevant ressources to get started ?<br>
FYI, I tried Unity which ticked a lot of boxes, on paper. I followed a paying online course but gave up after I tried to complete a basic tutorial where I was arranging objects and ran into a weird bug where the « Snap » tool wouldn’t work, tried to find the solution and all I could find after hours was a trail of people having the same problem since 2015 and no solution. Should I persevere ?<br>
I also tried Defold and I’ve been able to complete a few tutorials, it’s pretty good and might be enough in terms of features (3D is cool but not a prerequisite for me).<br>
I even thought about learning VB.Net because there are a few similarities with VBA (the horror ! the heresy !).<br>

Show notes:
00:00 Shamus is too busy!

Between the music class, some family difficulties, and some health issues, I’m really running out of hours. This is all temporary. I expect this is going to blow over in the next couple of weeks. Hopefully we don’t end up with another blank spot on the blog like last week.

03:44 Games where you can’t pick up enemy weapons / armor

Issac and I are making an article / video. In this video, I want to have an aside about how funny it is when a game won’t let you pick up weapons and armor from defeated foes. I’d like to have a visual to go along with this. 

Here is the question I have for you: Can you think of a game where defeated foes are depicted with clearly visible items that you can’t pick up, even though they would be immediately useful to your character? Like, “Look! There’s a sword on the ground! It’s right next to this guy I just killed, but I’m still using this dagger.” 

I  know I’ve played games with this problem in the past, but I’ve been thinking about it for days and I still can’t recall any concrete examples. 

05:27 Manifold Garden




13:27 Why talking about Hong Kong is bad for Shamus

Yeah, that’s ANOTHER reason this blog fell silent last week. After seeing too many pictures of violence and protests, I was kinda having a bit of a freak-out. I think I’m over it now, but we’re probably going to route around this topic for the next couple of weeks. I realize it’s important, but being it’s not worth being anxious, angry, and uncreative for a couple of days. I think the rest of the gaming press can pick up the slack just fine.

23:01 Mailbag: Gaming literacy

Dear Drs. The Diecast,
An interesting youtube video came across my feed recently (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax7f3JZJHSw) and it reminded me of Shamus’ old video back from 2008 about game literacy and how to introduce people to video games and how to play them, highlighting Prince of Persia as a good example.
Over a decade later how do you (plural) feel about the current state of video games and game literacy, and the barriers to entry? Do you think we’ve gotten any more games that can teach game literacy for people who’ve never played them before?
Sincerely,
Gabriel Mobius
Here is the video in question:




And here is the super-old, janky, and slightly cringe-worthy video Gabriel was referring to. Also, I’ve never revisited Prince of Persia 2008. It was pretty, but it was also sort of shallow and not terribly interesting.

31:13 Sky Islands Minecraft  

This is my first time playing a “floating islands” style modpack. It really is a very different experience. For the record, I’m playing Sky Odyssey.

33:34 Mailbag: Choose-once difficulty

Dear Diecast,
Why do so many games let you choose your difficulty at the start, but not allow you to change it partway through the game? It’s an obviously unfriendly design choice that keeps coming up and seems like it should be easy to fix. It feels like there has to be some technical restriction or UI reason for it, like how we keep getting two-gun-only FPSs so that console players don’t need a clunky weapon wheel to switch guns.
Ninety-Three
40:07 Mailbag: This Dumb Video Edit 

Dear diecast,
I’m wondering how Shamus makes his “This Dumb Industry” videos. I remember talking about Adobe Premier years ago on Diecast. Is it still the best for the job?
Yours,
Chris
Like I said on the show, Issac and I use CYBERLINK POWER DIRECTOR for editing. That name is a ridiculous mouthfull, so around here it gets shortened to “Cyberdoof”.

44:35 Mailbag: Development platform for small games?

Dear DieCast,
Been an avid reader of the blog since… I don’t know, a few years at least. Love the long-form analysis and all the past articles about programming. Here’s my question that you probably never heard !, and a little background information after, if you think that’s relevant (let’s keep it short…) :

But when recently went into the store, I saw that 90% of the sets were based on a popular property – Star Wars, Jurassic World, etc., and all of them seemed very run-of-the-mill and unimaginative. And I was wondering: was it always like this? Has Lego run out of ideas in recent years, or is it just my nostalgia talking?<br>

With that being said I caught myself thinking about some of the live-streams I’ve watched of Shamus playing GTAV and his preference for assaulting people with hats to knock off.

<p>Here are a pair of questions intended to go together. I read these in the wrong order, got sidetracked and confused for a little while, and then Paul course-corrected briefly before I lost the plot again.</p>
<p>I’m a professional!</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecastians,</p>
<p>There are multiple ways of scoring games out there.</p>
<p>If you could create your own preferred scoring system, what would it be?</p>
<p>1-9? 1-10? 1-100? 1-5? 1-6?&nbsp; something like avoid-rent-buy? 1-20? Yes-No? some other option?</p>
<p>Even more greetings,</p>
<p>Gresman</p></blockquote>

There is the known issues that games are scored somewhere around the 7 Mark as an average point, whereas in other mediums it is usually 5. Given that all scoring happens on a ten point scale.<br>
Is this fair or correct? Should we get rid of this deviation? Should we change the way games are rated?</p>

<p><strong>27:02 Mailbag: Unskippable Cutscenes</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Unskippable cutscenes. Why do they exist?</p>
<p>For me, it’s seems fairly obvious that players should never be forced to repeat a non-interactive portions of the game over and over. Even if the cutscenes themselves are fantastic, they cease to being impressive after I watched them 10+ times already – at this point all I am thinking about is how this particular obstacle is preventing me from playing the game. Worse, it makes me hate the story as well, because I associate it with being a waste of my time. Not to mention that even the perfect cutscene wouldn’t be able to survive the amount of scrutiny that our annoyed brains can muster.</p>
<p>The only reason I came up with is that sometimes they can hide a loading screen – in that case the situation is different. Besides that, I can’t think of any excuse.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this isn’t a common issue nowadays, but still – why was this a problem in the first place?</p>
<p>As usual, I apologize for any mistake that I made.</p>

<p><strong>35:57 Mailbag: Broken Game Economies</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Shamus,</p>
<p>I have too much money. Again.</p>
<p>I’m playing an open world RPG and I’ve reached the place where I have more in game money than I could ever possibly spend. I always seem to end up in this place in RPGs where money is a resource. In the beginning my character is dirt poor and I can’t afford anything. And then at some point in the mid-game I hit a point where things completely flip and I become so rich that I can buy everything in the game. The best weapons and armor come from bosses and chests and so money becomes worthless after awhile.</p>
<p>Have you seen any open world RPGs actually be good at this? Games frequently give you Renegade type interactions where you can demand more money for your quests. These options just seem so pointlessly dickish. You’re mean to an NPC and get like 10% bonus reward money. I never see the point in this, since money becomes worthless and the Paragon “Aw, shucks, keep it; you need the money more than I do,” option frequently gives you way better stuff. If money were worthwhile, I might choose to demand more payment. But I know in game I can make the money up on the back end by looting and selling more Kobold spears. Early in Witcher 3 money was scarce enough that I demanded what was promised (and getting paid for monster hunting is written into the core concept of the game, so that works well), but by mid-game I was choosing the “keep the money to rebuild your family” option whenever it was offered because I didn’t really need the money and the NPC would give me something nice, even if it was just extra grateful dialogue.</p>
<p>Can you think of any RPG-type games where money is actually a resource that matters? Any ideas for ways to improve it?</p>
<p>Trevor</p></blockquote>
<p>And yes, I realize that the game Paul and I both failed to think of was <em>Oblivion</em>.</p>
<p><strong>46:03 Mailbag: Non-graphics tech</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Ryan Gordon (a.k.a. Icculus) recently posted <a href="https://youtu.be/FpcrpAHB0ug">an announcement</a> about a new debug tool called alTrace, which is a tool that shows debug information about OpenAL.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about how in games we tend to focus more on graphics tech while not talking a lot about other advances, like audio tech.</p>
<p>What is your guys’ opinion on this?</p>
<p>Vale,</p>
<p>-Tim</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>52:55 Mailbag: Speech Checks</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>How do you like skill checks to work in dialogue-heavy RPGs? Should there be a D&amp;D-style element of randomness, or a system more like New Vegas where thirty points in Speech is a guaranteed success and any less is a failure? Should games be transparent about the difficulty of their skill checks, or should you have to click on the “Lie to this NPC” button without knowing for sure whether you can get away with it?</p>
<p>Ninety-Three</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>1:02:34 Mailbag: Gaming Burnout</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Shamus and Paul!</p>
<p>Do you experience gaming burnout and how often if so? When I was young I could play for hours and days, but now in my 30s while I still love games and have enough free time there are often periods of days and even weeks when I dont want to play anything at all. I start a game that I know I must like, play it for 30 minutes and stop, being completely bored. Then after a couple of days or weeks it goes away and I again can have fun playing video games. Sadly as I’m getting older this periods happen more and more often. How do you manage to play games and write about them for a living for so many years and not being tired of them?</p>
<p>Regards<br>
Dmitri</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>1:08:23 Mailbag: Ray-Traced Minecraft</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>So, seen the ray-traced Minecraft announcement yet? It sure looks pretty. It seems like a very Diecast kind of thing, so I was wondering if either of you had any plans to try it. It seems to require the Windows 10 version of the game and possibly an RTX card.</p>
<p>–John</p></blockquote>

Unskippable cutscenes. Why do they exist?
For me, it’s seems fairly obvious that players should never be forced to repeat a non-interactive portions of the game over and over. Even if the cutscenes themselves are fantastic, they cease to being impressive after I watched them 10+ times already – at this point all I am thinking about is how this particular obstacle is preventing me from playing the game.

<p>For those that missed it, here is the post describing the problems I had with the game: <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=41583">Wolfenstein II Part 2: Broken Technology</a>. The fact that it’s still broken on my <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=47616">new machine</a> is just ridiculous. And the unskippable splash screens are salt in the wound.</p>
<p><strong>39:19 Rage II is Also a Hot Mess</strong> </p>
<p>It’s not nearly as bad as Wolfie’s 2017 outing, </p>

<p><strong>54:43 Mailbag: WoW Classic</strong>  </p>
<blockquote><p>Dear diecast,</p>
<p>With WoW classic nearing release, I wonder how you guys feel about it. I initially thought it of it being people who cannot let go of the past, but the success of the lvl 15 preview, the popularity of the lvl 1-40 beta, servers filling up with name reservations 2 months for release (and people willing to shell out 15 bucks just to get their name), them having to get extra servers just to handle the amount of people coming in, and the constant hype buzzing around (youtube trying to hype me up even though I dont click the videos) I start to feel like this could be more than a month long distraction. And a significant playerbase will remain.</p>
<p>Also what do you think is WoW’s “X-factor” that MMOs that came after it all missed.</p>
<p>with kind regards<br>

For those that missed it, here is the post describing the problems I had with the game: Wolfenstein II Part 2: Broken Technology. The fact that it’s still broken on my new machine is just ridiculous. And the unskippable splash screens are salt in the wound.

39:19 Rage II is Also a Hot Mess 

It’s not nearly as bad as Wolfie’s 2017 outing, 

Also, I kinda dumped on Id Software in the segment, and that’s not really fair. Wolfenstein was made by Machine games and Rage 2 was from Avalanche. They’re using Id Tech, but they’re not made by Id. 

43:24 Spider-Man Custody Battle 

It’s a sad, silly story.

53:06 Mailbag: Forums  

Dear Diecast,
Any idea when the forum might be coming back?

54:43 Mailbag: WoW Classic  

Dear diecast,
With WoW classic nearing release, I wonder how you guys feel about it. I initially thought it of it being people who cannot let go of the past, but the success of the lvl 15 preview, the popularity of the lvl 1-40 beta, servers filling up with name reservations 2 months for release (and people willing to shell out 15 bucks just to get their name), them having to get extra servers just to handle the amount of people coming in, and the constant hype buzzing around (youtube trying to hype me up even though I dont click the videos) I start to feel like this could be more than a month long distraction. And a significant playerbase will remain.
Also what do you think is WoW’s “X-factor” that MMOs that came after it all missed.
with kind regards
chris

<p>For the record, this is about how <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=Ayz7bUYPG3A">Epic’s lack of features means the platform isn’t really ready for a huge AAA release like Borderlands 3</a>, and not about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ayz7bUYPG3A">class action lawsuit over a data breach</a>, breaking their own rules regarding their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6mHkx0oJUE&amp;t=639s">cash shop items</a>, or their recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkoWLYVDT_Y">PR gaffes</a>.

<p>Like I said on the show, let’s not heap too much additional hate on Extra Credits. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCj8llyzfWo">This is the video in question</a>. It’s got nearly a million views, which is more than 10 times the views the show has been getting lately. It has a 94% disapproval rating and the comments are an endless scroll of criticism. I think this bad premise has been thoroughly argued against by the community, and I imagine the EC crew gets the idea by now. </p>
<p>For the record, I’m actually acquaintances with some of the channel contributors. I think the criticism is well-earned, but it still makes me wince. I haven’t watched the show in years, but I really respect a lot of their early work.

<p><strong>32:51 Mailbag: Kingdom Come Deliverance  </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi!</p>
<p>So, I’ve just finished Kingdom Come Deliverance. If you not familiar with the game, its an open-world RPG somewhere between TES and The Witcher 3 (with some interesting own ideas) about medieval Bohemia.</p>
<p>I.e. its a purely historical setting, with no fantasy elements. So, by the end of the main story, I started to think more and more, that protagonist, former peasant Henry, is so easily taking very risky missions, which a normal person would never take willingly. The only explanation for such unreasonable risky behavior, that traumatic events of the prologue left Henry with a some kind of PTSD and he become an adrenaline junkie. I guess, that also explains, why Henry, in my playthrough, is also taking missions to steal all the valuable things even if money isn’t the issue for him</p>
<p>But that got me thinking. In other RPGs, or games in general, I never assume that heroes are adrenaline junkies. They just do dangerous missions, because they are just that cool. Say, Sheppard or Adam Jensen are such a pros, we as players don’t notice how close to the edge they actually are. Infiltrating a military base alone where any mistake will likely result in your death? If it was a real life, Jensen would likely try to think of ways to avoid this as much as possible. I’m now trying to imagine, what if we move Jensen to, say, being spy in WW1, would it be more obvious how dangerous his missions and his approach of solving problem alone are really are?</p>
<p>I think, this disconnect, is likely, explainable by how serious setting of KCD is (no magic, we’re infiltrating / fighting well armed bandits and such) and how meek looking Henry himself (plus that I decided to play on hardcore with all negative perks, which added to the element of danger). I’m pretty sure, that this is accidental in KCD. But still, that’s an interesting thing (recklessness caused by trauma), that I kinda want to see more in games or stories in general and explored deeply.</p>
<p>Do you think, that the amount of fantastical elements in a setting could result in seeing same actions of the same character in a drastically different light? But then, if I take Commando and Predator, the latter one is more fantastical, but Arnold is in real danger there… Its probably something else is contributing to this…</p>

<p><strong>38:26 Mailbag: Strange Technology Fails</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dearest Diecast.</p>
<p>Through no effort of my own, my music app has decided to use the picture of a robot girl (Aigis from Persona 3) as the album picture of the Diecast. I assume this happened because they both reside in my downloads folder, but I have no idea why just that picture was picked and why the app was so adamant on giving the Diecast an album image in the first place.</p>
<p>Do you have any stories to share about harmless but endlessly baffling technology mishaps that you just can’t explain?</p>

<p><strong>41:31 Mailbag: Toxic Customers</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear people, who like large numbers on physical objects,<br>
I get the distinct feeling that the customers in the games market are the most unpleasant ones out there. The unpleasantness does not seem to be certain demographic groups.<br>
There are horror story about the abuse of retail workers out there. In my experience customers in games seem to be far worse. I might be biased given that I had to do with a lot of major unpleasantness (murder threats and verbal abuse on a daily basis).<br>
This behaviour does not seem to exist in a B2B context. There the customers are demanding at most but mostly friendly.<br>
Any ideas on why this might be that way? Do you have any stories?</p>
<p>Greetings,<br>
Gresman</p></blockquote>
<p>I know a lot of you read the show notes without listening to the show. That’s fine. But please, if you haven’t listened to the show then maybe consider giving this topic a pass for now. This is a hot-button issue and on the show I did my best to present it in such a way as to minimize enragement. I’m worried some people will see the topic and come out swinging, and that won’t do anyone any good.</p>

03:06 Epic Game Store Fail No Preload for Borderlands 3

For the record, this is about how Epic’s lack of features means the platform isn’t really ready for a huge AAA release like Borderlands 3, and not about the class action lawsuit over a data breach, breaking their own rules regarding their cash shop items, or their recent PR gaffes.

<strong>00:00 Issac Needs a new GPU – Suggestions?</strong></p>
<p>I’m currently planning on picking up a GeForce GTX 1650 to replace the dead card, but I want to do a quick sanity check before I spend the money. I know how easy it is to get confused / misled / make a mistake. When Nvidia names their products, clarity is not their top priority. </p>
<p>If you have any advice, please share it in the comments. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>07:56 Stop asking me to turn on notifications!</strong></p>
<p>Ugh. I’m not annoyed at having to click “No thanks”, I’m annoyed by the sheer pointlessness of the entire system. It didn’t occur to me until after the show to wonder if there is a plugin to auto-refuse any such offers. After searching around, I discovered you don’t even need a plugin. Chrome has an option somewhere in the menus to block all such requests. Ideally, this popup:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/images/web_notifications.jpg"></p>
<p>…would also offer some sort of link to a way to turn off these silly things forever.</p>
<p>I found a site that explained how to disable notification popups. While reading it, I got a full-page popup that obscured the content with an invitation to subscribe to the site’s newsletter.</p>

<p><strong>58:37 Mailbag: Crowdfunding</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear diecast,</p>
<p>Currently the two big crowd funding possibilities are kickstarter and patreon. Yet both seem to fail different ways.

Show notes:
00:00 Issac Needs a new GPU – Suggestions?

I’m currently planning on picking up a GeForce GTX 1650 to replace the dead card, but I want to do a quick sanity check before I spend the money. I know how easy it is to get confused / misled / make a mistake. When Nvidia names their products, clarity is not their top priority. 

If you have any advice, please share it in the comments. Thanks!

07:56 Stop asking me to turn on notifications!

Ugh. I’m not annoyed at having to click “No thanks”, I’m annoyed by the sheer pointlessness of the entire system. It didn’t occur to me until after the show to wonder if there is a plugin to auto-refuse any such offers. After searching around, I discovered you don’t even need a plugin. Chrome has an option somewhere in the menus to block all such requests. Ideally, this popup:



…would also offer some sort of link to a way to turn off these silly things forever.

I found a site that explained how to disable notification popups. While reading it, I got a full-page popup that obscured the content with an invitation to subscribe to the site’s newsletter.

The internet was a mistake.

18:24 7 Billion Humans  




34:56 Moonlighter  




37:55 Fract OSC  




47:08 SkillShare isn’t… very good?  

To be fair, my only experience is with the music tutorials. Has anyone explored the other domains? Anything to report?

58:37 Mailbag: Crowdfunding

Dear diecast,
Currently the two big crowd funding possibilities are kickstarter and patreon. Yet both seem to fail different ways. Kickstarter is a lump sum, but if the developer doesnt know how to ration the money they run out with nothing to show. Patreon in this regard is better, they know how much they can spend every month, and if the project is more difficult than anticipated they can just work on it a month longer. At the other hand there is no reason for them to complete the game, ever. The system encourages feature creep.
So the question is (or two questions, if I may cheat)
1) which system would you say is the least bad
2) could you suggest a third system that would combine the strengths of these two platforms and avoid the pitfalls.
with kind regards
chris

		<p>Another wrinkle in the adventure to get the RSS feed working: As I’ve said before, the only way to get the podcast RSS to do its job is to place a link to the show somewhere in the post.

<strong>00:00 Busy Week</strong></p>
<p>The Summer Games Done Quick is this week. Here are a few of the runs I’m looking forward to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sunday – Portal 2</strong>: Speedruns of Portal are often hard to follow because the runner spends so much time out of bounds and instantly blinking from one location to the next. This one promises to be an in-bounds run, so I’m hoping this will be more aerial acrobatics and less strobing skybox.</li>
<li><strong>Monday – Prey:</strong> The fastest possible run of Prey takes just a couple of minutes and is really boring because the runner spends most of the run out of bounds, slowly climbing a tower. This run will be about doing all main quests, so it will probably be more interesting to watch.</li>
<li><strong>Monday – Titanfall 2:</strong> Really? You can speedrun this? I always got the impression that modern shooters were pretty locked down and didn’t leave a lot of room for crazy shortcuts and exploits. I guess we’ll see.</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday – Dark Souls II:</strong> It’s always fun to see a speedrun of a Dark Souls game, particularly if you know what the game looks like when played by mortals.</li>
<li><strong>Friday – 90s Shooters:</strong> We’re going to see Quake, Half-Life, and Half-Life 2 run back-to-back. That should be fun.</li>
<li><strong>Friday – Minecraft:</strong> They had a Minecraft run last year, but that was based on a fixed seed where the runner had memorized the key locations of everything. This run will be based on a random seed, and I’m very curious how they’re going to make that work.</li>
<li><strong>Friday: Dark Souls:</strong> Another all bosses run.</li>
<li><strong>Saturday – Skyrim:</strong> Most Skyrim runs have the runner clip through a wall somewhere and skip 90% of the game. This run will tackle the entire main quest in just 45 minutes. I’m looking forward to seeing how that works.</li>
</ul>
<p>These aren’t the only runs I want to watch, but these are my favorites. Are you planning on watching? What runs are you looking forward to?</p>
<p><strong>03:39 Rebel Galaxy</strong></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>22:01 Astroneer</strong></p>
<p>Such a massive disappointment. A lot of work went into this game. And the devs are still working on it! It’s gotten several updates this year. But the stuttering is a severe problem and it’s evidently on their “won’t fix” list for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Shame.</p>
<p><strong>27:37 Destiny 2</strong></p>
<p>It really is crazy how <em>Anthem</em> and <em>Destiny 2</em> both have such severe loading screens. I think their levels must fall into some sort of worst-of-both-worlds scenario for size. Open world games like GTA V have epic load times, but you generally only need to pay that cost once. When the initial loading ends, you’re free to move around the entire world without hindrance. Other games have little bite-sized levels so the load screens are frequent but short.</p>
<p><em>Anthem</em> and <em>Destiny 2</em> have zones that are just large enough to make loading painful, but not large enough to contain the entire gameworld.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a lot of these environments are completely linear. This is particularly true for <em>Anthem</em>‘s strongholds.&nbsp; It should be possible to stream the level a few rooms at a time and do invisibly in the background.</p>
<p>Two console generations ago, everyone went crazy for motion controllers. The current gen is all bout VR / 4k / 60fps. Maybe this next generation of consoles will all fight over who can give us the shortest loading times.</p>
<p>It’s not likely, but I do hope we’ll see some progress.</p>
<p><strong>31:28 A little Rimeing</strong></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>38:24 Sunset Overdrive</strong></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>High mobility combat. Sense of humor. Open world. Lots of character customization. Colorful visuals. This seems right up my alley, but I feel kinda “meh” about it.</p>
<p><strong>44:06 Leaving good source code comments is kinda like game design.</strong></p>
<p>This topic came from a Jon Blow livestream, but it doesn’t look like the VOD has been uploaded. It’s not important. Paul and I sort of take the topic in our own direction.</p>
<p><strong>55:54 Mailbag: Loot Box Law</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Liebe Personen, die Würfel werfen,</p>
<p>A few weeks ago there was a story about a proposed bill to regulate loot boxes and similar mechanic. Any thoughts on this topic?<br>

Open world games like GTA V have epic load times, but you generally only need to pay that cost once. When the initial loading ends, you’re free to move around the entire world without hindrance. Other games have little bite-sized levels so the load screens are frequent but short.

Anthem and Destiny 2 have zones that are just large enough to make loading painful, but not large enough to contain the entire gameworld.

On the other hand, a lot of these environments are completely linear. This is particularly true for Anthem‘s strongholds.  It should be possible to stream the level a few rooms at a time and do invisibly in the background.

Two console generations ago, everyone went crazy for motion controllers. The current gen is all bout VR / 4k / 60fps. Maybe this next generation of consoles will all fight over who can give us the shortest loading times.

It’s not likely, but I do hope we’ll see some progress.

31:28 A little Rimeing




38:24 Sunset Overdrive




High mobility combat. Sense of humor. Open world. Lots of character customization. Colorful visuals. This seems right up my alley, but I feel kinda “meh” about it.

44:06 Leaving good source code comments is kinda like game design.

This topic came from a Jon Blow livestream, but it doesn’t look like the VOD has been uploaded. It’s not important. Paul and I sort of take the topic in our own…</itunes:summary>

<p><strong>07:31 Mailbag: Nier Automata</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast:</p>
<p>I finished Nier: Automata a couple months ago, and I’ve been thinking about it a lot since then — because oh boy, the story is a mess. Not bad, mind you, but definitely a mess, and the fascinating kind of mess at that. And I really, really want to see you analyze it.</p>
<p>So I was wondering. You got a new computer recently, right? Have you tried N:A on it, to see if it still crashes? I’ve read that the game tends not to do well with the 7xx series in particular, so it might do fine on the new machine.</p>
<p>Failing that: you have a PS4, right? Can I/anyone else who’s interested gift you a copy?</p>

<p>I looked in my archives, and Terry did not sign their email, so it wasn’t my fault this time.</p>
<p><strong>11:56 Mailbag: Cutscene Skipping</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Injection Molding,</p>
<p>How do you feel about skipping cutscenes in games where the story isn’t very good? What makes you decide to skip a cutscene, and is it a scene-by-scene choice or do you decide “I don’t care any more, I’m going to skip everything”?</p>
<p>As I’ve gotten older, I’ve noticed myself becoming more and more willing to go into “Skip all cutscenes, I’m only here for the gameplay” mode. I’m not sure if there’s a specific thing I’m looking for, but it feels like years of experience have made it easier to recognize whether a game’s story will be worth my time, and now it usually only takes a few hours before I bail out of the game’s narrative.</p>

<blockquote><p>To Diecast,</p>

<p>From my perspective you have from 1999 to around 2015 (PC anyway) the highest end of display technology being FHD ie 1080p and then along comes 4k and then before 4k can become standardized along comes 8k and from there who knows, perhaps soon enough we’ll see 2kk, also you have things like HDR and other bells and whistles<br>
Could we be heading towards a sort of arms race with respect to monitors/TV’s? Does the pure pixel count of say 8k mean anything for the developers side? Additional thoughts/speculation?</p>

<p><strong>35:38 Mailbag: Why are people reluctant to use the Epic Store?</strong></p>
<p>I feel like we covered this recently, but it’s an interesting topic and I don’t mind covering it again.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast</p>
<p>Why are people reluctant to use the Epic Store? Steam’s features are nice to have, but I can’t imagine internet rage about Epic exclusives is just because people really wanted to play e.g. Phoenix Point with Steam achievements and friends lists.</p>
<p>I ran into this in my own thinking. The Epic Games Store had a sale with $10 off all titles, so I had to decide whether it was worth an extra $10 to buy some game on Steam or EGS. Eventually I decided that nothing about Steam was worth $10 and bought the game on Epic, but that makes it sound immediately obvious and somehow it took me several minutes to decide. I’m still not sure why I feel like Steam is much better.</p>
<p>Are people just attached to their routines and annoyed by Epic trying to change them, or do you think Steam provides some specific value that people are fighting to defend?</p>
<p>Ninety-Three</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>46:06 Mailbag: Gamer Boycotts</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>There has been a lot of noise of late from gamers who are discontent with certain decisions that game devs/publishers are making. Notable examples are things like EGS exclusives and EA making a mess of… everything.</p>
<p>While conventional wisdom holds that companies listen to customers who vote with their wallets, games that are being complained about seem to sell a fair share of copies. Do you guys think that gamers just don’t have the discipline to actually follow up with their threats?</p>
<p>Keep up the good work!</p>

<p><strong>50:32 Mailbag: Anon Video</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>dear diecast,</p>
<p>1) will there ever be another “this dumb industry”. Initially you said you would return to it if you found something infuriating, but i haven’t seen a post like it since.</p>
<p>2) valve and blizzard seem to have a similar fall of grace and have a similar lofty background. Is it fair to compare their fall from grace side by side or are they completely different and just happen to collapse at the same time</p>
<p>3) related to above question. Is it possible for a small studio to deliver another brilliant title like halflife or do modern AAA games require such a large crew that a big name title by a new developer like valve or remedy (max payne) can no longer happen</p>
<p>4) a bit longer question. A while ago under an andromedea retrospective post I joked about how if you would be in the writer’s chair you would also have to write romance. To which you replied you wouldnt be too happy about that. A nice discussion happened to that. And overal it seemed people were confused (for a lack of a better word) about romance in videogames.</p>
<p>Which leads me to the question. Can you write good optional romance in a videogame. Most optional romance (romance no part of the central plot) seems to be mostly about “talk to the girl you like X times and do quest Y and you get the girl”.. This seems stupid, but at the other hand most often the MC is a capable, attractive and interesting character. So it s/he seems to tick most of the boxes of a romantic partner. So really, how can you write romance in a story if it is not integral to the story.</p>

<p>Show notes:<span id="more-47174"></span></p>
<p><strong>00:00 The annoying Diecast feed problem.</strong></p>
<p>Maybe it’s fixed again. For now.</p>
<p>Mostly this is a rant about their constant attempts to idiot-proof WordPress over the years. To a certain extent, this is understandable. The vast majority of WordPress users are not tech-savvy coders, they’re writers and whatnot. Giving those people a way to easily put content on the internet is the entire point of the platform. But in automating things for the people looking for turnkey solutions, they keep making it more and more difficult for power users with custom scripts.</p>
<p>Yes, you can fork WordPress if you like and make it behave however you want. But then you’re either stuck on that old version<span class="snote" title="1">Not really viable, since just about every new release has a few fixes for security vulnerabilities.</span>, or you’re doomed to re-apply those changes to every new version of WordPress. That’s a lot of hassle. Since the whole point of my extensions is to avoid hassle, it’s not really a winning solution for me.</p>
<p><strong>10:41 Returning to the Witness </strong></p>
<p>One thing I forgot to mention: I fixed the slow walking problem by turning the FOV up to 110. Even though you still move at the same speed, a large FOV will make your walking <strong>feel</strong> faster. It’s a silly trick, but it let me walk around the island without getting restless and impatient.</p>
<p><strong>27:08 Standardized Testing</strong></p>
<p>Bit of a digression here. </p>
<p><strong>32:37 Outer Wilds</strong></p>
<p>I feel bad for dumping on this game. Everyone else seems so charmed by it, but it doesn’t work for me. </p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>41:55 Quake 2 PT</strong></p>
<p>Looking at my screenshots more closely, I can see I was wrong. The game isn’t using the textures to create some sort of ad-hoc bump mapping.</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>In the screenshot above, you’ll see a green shine on the floor from the overhead light source. That obviously wasn’t part of the original Quake 2 back in 1997. For some reason those shiny bits made me think some sort of bump mapping going on, but in the screenshot you can see the floor is clearly smooth. If there was bump-mapping, then those reflections would be impacted by the shape of the floor. For example, the rivets in the floor would be catching individual highlights. Without bumps, this advanced lighting kind of shatters the illusion that textures are supposed to create. Instead of looking like a coarse surface of industrial metal, it looks like a perfectly smooth floor with really ugly wallpaper. </p>
<p>Now I’m wondering what it <strong>would</strong> look like with auto-generated bump maps. I’ve done that effect a lot over the years in various experiments. It’s never great, but it might really help in a weird edge case like this one where you’re trying to do complex lighting on very low-res textures from the 90s.</p>
<p><strong>50:04 Mailbag: Survival Meters</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>A common criticism of recent open world survival games, like We Happy Few and Pathologic 2, is that managing all the various meters (hunger, thirst, etc) is tedious busywork that distracts from exploring the interesting world. Do you think it is possible to make juggling meters fun? Or did Minecraft made a mistake when it first came up with the idea?</p>
<p>Your sincerity,</p>
<p>Pierre</p>
<p>P.S. Can you please tell me where I can find the Diecast theme?</p></blockquote>

Show notes:

00:00 The annoying Diecast feed problem.

Maybe it’s fixed again. For now.

Mostly this is a rant about their constant attempts to idiot-proof WordPress over the years. To a certain extent, this is understandable. The vast majority of WordPress users are not tech-savvy coders, they’re writers and whatnot. Giving those people a way to easily put content on the internet is the entire point of the platform. But in automating things for the people looking for turnkey solutions, they keep making it more and more difficult for power users with custom scripts.

Yes, you can fork WordPress if you like and make it behave however you want. But then you’re either stuck on that old versionNot really viable, since just about every new release has a few fixes for security vulnerabilities., or you’re doomed to re-apply those changes to every new version of WordPress. That’s a lot of hassle. Since the whole point of my extensions is to avoid hassle, it’s not really a winning solution for me.

10:41 Returning to the Witness 

One thing I forgot to mention: I fixed the slow walking problem by turning the FOV up to 110. Even though you still move at the same speed, a large FOV will make your walking feel faster. It’s a silly trick, but it let me walk around the island without getting restless and impatient.

27:08 Standardized Testing

Bit of a digression here. 

32:37 Outer Wilds

I feel bad for dumping on this game. Everyone else seems so charmed by it, but it doesn’t work for me. 




41:55 Quake 2 PT

Looking at my screenshots more closely, I can see I was wrong. The game isn’t using the textures to create some sort of ad-hoc bump mapping.




In the screenshot above, you’ll see a green shine on the floor from the overhead light source. That obviously wasn’t part of the original Quake 2 back in 1997. For some reason those shiny bits made me think some sort of bump mapping going on, but in the screenshot you can see the floor is clearly smooth. If there was bump-mapping, then those reflections would be impacted by the shape of the floor. For example, the rivets in the floor would be catching individual highlights. Without bumps, this advanced lighting kind of shatters the illusion that textures are supposed to create. Instead of looking like a coarse surface of industrial metal, it looks like a perfectly smooth floor with really ugly wallpaper. 

Now I’m wondering what it would look like with auto-generated bump maps. I’ve done that effect a lot over the years in various experiments. It’s never great, but it might really help in a weird edge case like this one where you’re trying to do complex lighting on very low-res textures from the 90s.

50:04 Mailbag: Survival Meters

Dear Diecast,
A common criticism of recent open world survival games, like We Happy Few and Pathologic 2, is that managing all the various meters (hunger, thirst, etc) is tedious busywork that distracts from exploring the interesting world. Do you think it is possible to make juggling meters fun? Or did Minecraft made a mistake when it first came up with the idea?
Your sincerity,
Pierre
P.S. Can you please tell me where I can find the Diecast theme?

45:53 Mailbag: Phantom Menace

Hello Shamus and Paul,
This month marks the 20th anniversary of the Phantom Menace, the first of the Star Wars Prequel Movies. 
I’ve read lots of articles looking back at it and how the fans’ opinion of it has changed over the years. Some started legitimately enjoying it while others still see the bad but enjoy it due to the campy acting and pretty visuals. 
My question is, how did you view the Phantom Menace back in 1999 and has your opinion changed since then? 
A lot of the articles and video documentaries also talk about how ‘the generation that grew up with the prequels’ is remembering them more fondly than fans who grew up with the Original Trilogy. Do your kids think differenly about the prequels as well? How do they view things like Jar Jar, all the Senate scenes etc. ? 
Sincerely,
Lucas

      <link>https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=47072</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[
		<p>Welcome to Diecast #2<sup>8</sup>. Honestly, it seems like a waste to keep going after hitting such a sweet landmark. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=18831">The first episode of the Diecast</a> was posted on February 14, 2013. Most episodes run just slightly over an hour, but occasionally they run to 1.5 hours and very rarely they approach 2. If we assume the average length is an hour and 20 minutes, then there are 341 hours of Diecast. That’s almost exactly two solid weeks of talking about videogames. I don’t know why you’re not sick of me by now, but I’m glad this is working.</p>

<p>Show notes:<span id="more-47072"></span></p>
<p><strong>00:33 Shamus recants regarding framerate.</strong>  </p>
<p>If you want to test for yourself, you can view <a href="https://www.testufo.com/framerates-marquee#count=3&amp;pps=1200">this page</a>, which should show you images moving at various framerates. I know this isn’t quite the same as viewing a whole-frame 3D image, but it’s enough to illustrate what I’m talking about.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m never going back. </p>
<p>I remember going through the same thing when we made the jump from 16 bit color to 32 bit color. At the start I thought 16 was fine and 32 was a needless luxury for obsessive people. Then after getting used to 32 bit I used a machine that was still using a late-90s 16 bit card and I thought it looked <strong>awful</strong>. The difference looks something like this:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>If you’re storing the color values in just 16 bits, then you’ve got 4 bits for red, 4 bits for green, 4 for blue, and 4 for alpha. There were other packing schemes that took some of the bits from the alpha channel or gave extra bits to green where we’re most sensitive to color changes, but the basic problem of color banding remains. Of course, the problem is exacerbated by this photo-realistic image. Then again, the problem is slightly mitigated by the high resolution of the image. The banding would look a lot more severe if this image was 800×600 or even 640×480. </p>
<p>The point is, color depth was one of those things that seemed extravagant until I had it, and then it became a necessity. It seems like high framerates is a similar deal.</p>
<p>I promise I’ll try to avoid turning into a full-on framerate snob in the future.</p>
<p><strong>06:01 SatisFactory is the worst corridor shooter.</strong></p>
<p>BUT CAN YOU ROCKET JUMP?</p>
<p><strong>12:50 Issac Broke Risk of Rain</strong> </p>
<p>Issac began taking screenshots as soon at the problem began to manifest. Below is the first shot, before things got really out of control. In the lower right is a box with the number 16 in it, which is how many seconds until the ability fires again and summons four more drones. On the left is a vertical list saying “Strike Drone” over and over again (mixed in with some other random minions he had) to show how many have been summoned so far. In the middle of the screen you can see a bunch of floating yellow triangles. Each triangle marks the location of a drone. All the debris is from the mass of monsters that drones just wiped out.</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>Thirty seconds later, things had gotten out of control. You can see the drone list is overwhelmed. In the lower corner, notice that the cooldown says it’s now -1308 seconds until the ability fires again. This means the ability was probably firing every frame or every game tick, depending on how things are set up.</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>From here, it just got worse. You can see the cooldown is now negative eleven thousand. Also, I’m pretty sure the screen is pure white because there are so many overlapping particle effects that they saturated the entire scene.</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>Looking at this now, I see the timestamp (upper right corner) in the above shot is a few seconds before the previous shot. Sorry. It’s hard to make sense of the screenshots and the exact timing of everything. Issac was attempting to flee the area while running at 1 frame a second, so most of the screenshots are just random chaos like you see above. Anyway, you get the idea.</p>
<p><strong>19:00 Metro Exodus</strong>  </p>
<p>I was going to get some screenshots of this in action, but I didn’t think to get out my phone and take pictures of my keyboard to go with them.</p>
<p>I’m curious if everyone else has the same impression I do. Didn’t it seem like this game came and went really quickly? Do you think that’s do to it being an Epic Store exclusive, or because the game itself just didn’t connect with people?</p>
<p><strong>25:32 Issac is using Hammer Editor.</strong></p>
<p>Issac has informed me that the slowdown only happens when the level is <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Leak">properly sealed</a>, and doesn’t seem related to the lighting. (Also, putting it on fast compile shortens the wait to a few seconds.) I still have many questions. Issac’s level is geometrically simple – it’s just a series of box rooms connected by corridors. I was building those kinds of levels on a 166Mhz PC back in the 1990s, and that same BSP operation for a level of the same complexity was under half a minute.</p>
<p>So what is Hammer<span class="snote" title="1">Actually, the BSP process is handled by a command-line program (WHAT YEAR IS IT?) invoked by Hammer called VBSP.</span> doing with 15 minutes of modern-day computing power?!?</p>
<p><strong>33:55 Mailbag: Engine Building Games</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Your discussion on Risk of Rain prompted me to finally play the copy I’ve had for a shameful amount of time. I’ve realised that what it really feels like is an engine building game. Different genre – ish, but I put Slay the Spire in the same box.</p>
<p>Engine builders tend to be board games where victory comes from setting up an ‘engine’ with interacting cards or resources and running it. The interactions may make other interactions stronger, or deal with their negative effects, or allow them to trigger more frequently – much like in RoR how your son finds game breaking combos,  or infinite damage loops in Spite. Usually, games like Scythe, London and some ways of playing Magic fell into this category.</p>
<p>Have you found any other similar engine building experiences on PC? My current damage exploding Borderlands 2 Psycho feels a bit that way,  as well as more commonly in tycoon games. Occasionally,  Michael Brough’s games too. </p>
<p>With great affection, </p>
<p>Lachlan</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>39:10 Mailbag: New Dwarf Fortress</strong>  </p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Hi! I recently saw that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/03/13/dwarf-fortress-premium-version/">a new version Dwarf Fortress</a> is coming to Steam and itch.io. The game will also have graphics, and support Steam Workshop upgrades. My question is: do any of you plan on playing it (I know Paul’s had some experience with it), and do you think it can supplant its competition in the face of Rimworld, Factorio, Satisfactory and the like? Also, how appealing would it be to someone who’s never played it?</p>
<p>Keep being Awesome,<br>
Lino</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>44:20 Mailbag: Re-playing games vs. New Games</strong>  </p>
<blockquote><p>Hey Shamus and Paul,</p>
<p>Do you ever find yourself returning to older games that you have played<br>
many times before, even if they’re not great, instead of playing new games that you would most likely enjoy?</p>
<p>I’ve been re-reading your Mass Effect retrospective, and it really makes me want to go back and play the through the trilogy again for the 3rd time, even though I have a huge backlog of games that I own and have never played, including some that I’m sure I would like if I ever played them.</p>
<p>I think there’s a level of comfort involved with playing an older game. You know exactly what to expect, with regards to both the mechanics and the story. I feel like I sometimes suffer from “new game fatigue” where I want to play a new game, but as soon as I start it, I realize that I have to learn a new system and mechanics, and I just don’t feel like putting in the effort. It feels like with most games these days, especially RPGs and strategy games, there’s a huge learning curve just to get to the point where you feel like you feel like you know what you are doing. It’s easier to just load up a game you’ve played before and not have to work too hard. Maybe it’s part of being older as well and having less time to dedicate toward playing games. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the subject.</p>
<p>Jason</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>48:54 Cities Skylines Boring Start</strong></p>
<p>This was an unplanned aside. Actually, I think it deserves an entire article. The early game has so many of these frustrating obligations that force you to build a stupid broken city that you’ll have to tear apart and fix later. You can fix this by using a mod to unlock all the stuff you need up front, but then you start the game with the entire city demanding all these different services at once, when you don’t have enough money to meet those needs. You can fix this with more mods, but after a while it feels like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV:_Oblivion">Oblivion</a> problem where you’re trying to re-balance an entire game by stringing together disparate mods.</p>

      <itunes:summary>Welcome to Diecast #28. Honestly, it seems like a waste to keep going after hitting such a sweet landmark. 

The first episode of the Diecast was posted on February 14, 2013. Most episodes run just slightly over an hour, but occasionally they run to 1.5 hours and very rarely they approach 2. If we assume the average length is an hour and 20 minutes, then there are 341 hours of Diecast. That’s almost exactly two solid weeks of talking about videogames. I don’t know why you’re not sick of me by now, but I’m glad this is working.


Hosts: Paul, Shamus. Episode edited by Issac.

Show notes:

00:33 Shamus recants regarding framerate.  

If you want to test for yourself, you can view this page, which should show you images moving at various framerates. I know this isn’t quite the same as viewing a whole-frame 3D image, but it’s enough to illustrate what I’m talking about.

Anyway, I’m never going back. 

I remember going through the same thing when we made the jump from 16 bit color to 32 bit color. At the start I thought 16 was fine and 32 was a needless luxury for obsessive people. Then after getting used to 32 bit I used a machine that was still using a late-90s 16 bit card and I thought it looked awful. The difference looks something like this:




If you’re storing the color values in just 16 bits, then you’ve got 4 bits for red, 4 bits for green, 4 for blue, and 4 for alpha. There were other packing schemes that took some of the bits from the alpha channel or gave extra bits to green where we’re most sensitive to color changes, but the basic problem of color banding remains. Of course, the problem is exacerbated by this photo-realistic image. Then again, the problem is slightly mitigated by the high resolution of the image. The banding would look a lot more severe if this image was 800×600 or even 640×480. 

The point is, color depth was one of those things that seemed extravagant until I had it, and then it became a necessity. It seems like high framerates is a similar deal.

I promise I’ll try to avoid turning into a full-on framerate snob in the future.

06:01 SatisFactory is the worst corridor shooter.

BUT CAN YOU ROCKET JUMP?

12:50 Issac Broke Risk of Rain 

Issac began taking screenshots as soon at the problem began to manifest. Below is the first shot, before things got really out of control. In the lower right is a box with the number 16 in it, which is how many seconds until the ability fires again and summons four more drones. On the left is a vertical list saying “Strike Drone” over and over again (mixed in with some other random minions he had) to show how many have been summoned so far. In the middle of the screen you can see a bunch of floating yellow triangles. Each triangle marks the location of a drone. All the debris is from the mass of monsters that drones just wiped out.




Thirty seconds later, things had gotten out of control. You can see the drone list is overwhelmed. In the lower corner, notice that the cooldown says it’s now -1308 seconds until the ability fires again. This means the ability was probably firing every frame or every game tick, depending on how things are set up.




From here, it just got worse. You can see the cooldown is now negative eleven thousand. Also, I’m pretty sure the screen is pure white because there are so many overlapping particle effects that they saturated the entire scene.




Looking at this now, I see the timestamp (upper right corner) in the above shot is a few seconds before the previous shot. Sorry. It’s hard to make sense of the screenshots and the exact timing of everything. Issac was attempting to flee the area while running at 1 frame a second, so most of the screenshots are just random chaos like you see above. Anyway, you get the idea.

19:00 Metro Exodus  

I was going to get some screenshots of this in action, but I didn’t think to get out my phone and take pictures of my keyboard to go with them.

I’m curious if everyone else has the same i…</itunes:summary>

		<p>Welcome to Diecast #2<sup>8</sup>-1! Just a heads up: This episode is basically me talking frantically for an hour while Paul does his best to squeeze in the occasional sentence fragment. If you’re here for me, then this should be fun. If you’re here for a conversation, then I have failed you.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure what to do about <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> spoilers. The whole movie is a barrage of surprises and fanservice, so trying to talk about Endgame without spoilers is like trying to talk about Tombstone without mentioning cowboys. You <strong>can</strong> do it, but in the end it’s a lot of trouble for a very dubious benefit. I did my best to avoid giving away the big surprises, but you should probably just go see the movie if you’re spoiler-shy. You know how the internet is when people get excited. You’re bound to blunder into a spoiler pretty soon.</p>

Have you ever done in-depth dives of Starcraft? I feel like there’s something to be said for the games’ story…not so much that the plot is all that amazing, but the tone is astonishingly pitch-perfect, and puts the player pretty deep in the world despite the generic characters and plot. Your own mileage may vary, do you have games that you’re unimpressed with story-wise but that really do it for you in terms of tone and world-feel?<br>

I wanted to write this question last week, but didn’t know how to formulate it without sounding like a… not a nice person. I hope I don’t sound like that now. But since you’ve touched this topic on escapist, I decided to give a try.
You’ve likely heard that Sekiro is the 4th most played game on Steam ( https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-03-24-sekiro-shadow-die-twice-is-already-steams-fourth-most-played-game ).

But because they were so good at working with this niche, other, older, age groups became more interested and ratings risen up. I wonder, if we have a similar effect here. Do you think it makes sense?

<li>On the box, it promises that Just Dance Unlimited offers “over 400” songs. On the website, the sales pitch for JDU claims “over 200”. Then in the game proper, it says “over 300”. And at no time can you ever see a list telling you what you’ll get.</li>
<li>Every time she selected a song, the game claimed it couldn’t connect to the Ubisoft servers. (Our internet was otherwise working perfectly, so it’s doubtful the problem was on our end.) She could play some songs, but others would give these odd network errors.</li>
<li>After rebooting the Wii U, the game said she needed to create an Ubisoft account. That’s reasonable enough, but then why didn’t it ask for that up front? Why did it let her play parts of the game and give strange network errors if the real problem was it required an account? Did anyone test this?</li>
<li>There’s a high score feature. On one of the songs the game said she got the highest score. You’d think it would say this for ALL songs, since she’d never played any of them before. But she got the highest score on just one. So is this some public / global high score table? If so, it’s kind of useless since there was no indication of how many other people were playing or had ever played any of these songs.</li>
<li>The game records video of you dancing, with no way to turn it off. She eventually just covered up the Wii U camera.</li>
<li>The game awards you in some bullshit points or whatever. You then use this junk currency to pay for spins on a slot machine, and that’s how you unlock new content. Imagine you’re out for a jog and you have to stop every three minutes and play with a slot machine on your phone. That should give you an idea of how awkward and unwelcome this feature is.</li>
<li>The slot machine is very flashy. My wife has to look away from the screen because it gives her a headache.</li>
<li>It’s obvious they didn’t really have a lot of content for the slot machine. Like, new icons for yourself, or new titles for your character.</li>
<li>Aside from the slot machine, you also unlock other things through playing the game. She won things like THE HOME SCREEN and THE ABILITY TO MAKE PLAYLISTS. You know, basic features.</li>
</ul>
<p>She loves Just Dance, but she described this experience as being “So very Ubisoft.”</p>

<p><strong>42:35 Mailbag: Bad games making WORSE games look better.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hello Shamus and Paul,</p>
<p>I recently had a conversation with a friend about Fallout 76, specifically about how it makes Fallout 4 look a lot better by comparison. No (or really less) game breaking bugs, better experience due to an actual in-game narrative and overall just more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Thing is, I had almost the same conversation a few years ago. But back then it was about Fallout 4 vs Fallout 3. And how Fallout 4 makes Fallout 3 look a lot better by comparison. Things like an actual skill system, the dialog system and a plot that at least, had a clear villain (The enclave… and your dad).</p>
<p>I guess one thing that’s at work here is constrast effect (eg. Well… at least it’s not fallout 4…). That and nostalgia (eg. The newer game just might not evoke that same feeling as the previous game).</p>
<p>But I think it’s wierd that games like Fallout 3 or Mass Effect 3 (when compared with Andromeda) Suddenly get this status as ‘secretly great all along’ while nothing about the game has changed, only something came along that’s ‘worse’.</p>
<p>I guess my question is, what are your thoughts on this phenomenon? Did you ever look back on a game you played years ago and think ‘hmmm actually it’s not as bad’ when compared with newer games (in the franchise) and later realised you still kind of felt the same about it?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Paul</p></blockquote>

<p>I feel like we didn’t do this topic justice because I got sidetracked and dragged us WAY off-topic here. Sorry about that.</p>

00:20 Ubisoft’s Just Dance Unlimited

For the record, Just Dance Unlimited is a service you sign up for in addition to buying the game. You don’t need the service to play the game, but if you get the service then you’ll have more dances to do. In addition to the problems I talked about on the show, Heather had additional annoyances she told me about the next morning:


On the box, it promises that Just Dance Unlimited offers “over 400” songs. On the website, the sales pitch for JDU claims “over 200”. Then in the game proper, it says “over 300”. And at no time can you ever see a list telling you what you’ll get.

22:03 Everything is Early access

Are more games being released in Early Access, or am I just playing an unusual number of them? I don’t even know how you’d go about giving a definitive answer to this.

28:04 Paul’s New Computer

In this segment, I sort of take a swipe at the idea of limiting “screen time” for kids. This Penny Arcade strip pretty much sums up how I feel about it. It wasn’t until later that I remembered that this is an incredibly controversial argument in the parenting scene. My wife Heather runs a parenting group on Facebook, and this is one of those topics that always seems to start a fire.

<strong>00:00 Dumpster Kittens</strong>  </p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>According to my daughter:</p>
<blockquote><p>The three in the box are Dwight(Black+White paint) Lady(Brown Tabby) and Ava(Mostly black). The one off on his own is Goblin, our little sickie baby.</p></blockquote>
<p>Looks like they’re all going to make it. Thanks to everyone who tossed a few bucks into the GoFundMe. </p>
<p><strong>02:24 Ditching Twitter</strong></p>
<p>I don’t know if this is something the algorithm does for everyone, or if I somehow broke it so that it always wanted to show me the things I least wanted to see.</p>
<p>I don’t want to make too big a deal about this. All I did was close an account. I’m not trying to make some statement and convince the world that we should all abandon Twitter. I don’t care that other people still use it. I was just sickened by the stuff the algorithm promoted and I decided I didn’t need a steady drip of that nonsense. </p>
<p>I’m having to remember how I followed gaming news in the pre-Twitter days. I have to open up gaming sites directly and scroll through the headlines like some sort of savage. I should probably look and see if Reddit has any aggregation for gaming news. </p>
<p><strong>19:57 Email Hack</strong> </p>
<p>It was a minor problem that was quickly fixed, but I did lose about 24 hours of email. Still, I do wonder how I lost control of that account. I usually use strong passwords.</p>
<p><strong>23:43 Risk of Rain 2</strong></p>
<p>During the show I talked about how I was working on getting the achievement / unlock for surviving for 20 levels. I got it about 3 hours after we wrapped the show:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>I’m kind of sad that I’m basically done with everything for now. I’m having a lot of fun with this one, but I think I’ll shelve it until the devs roll out a few more features. The game is still in early access and there’s supposedly a lot more content on the way.</p>
<p>Also: I did not give Paul accurate information regarding the sealed chamber. Issac informed me that <strike>there are a couple of buttons nearby, and you need to press them both at once. It’s trivial to do if you’re playing with a friend, but if you’re playing alone then you have to shove one of the nearby pots onto the switch. This is hard, since the pots are explosive and you’ve usually got people shooting at you. I plan to drop the Engineer’s turret on one of the buttons and see if that counts.</strike></p>
<p><strong>37:34 Cardlife Abandoned</strong> </p>
<p>What a shame. I was planning to pick this up once it started coming together. It’s a fun idea with a great look. But now it’s (apparently) abandoned.</p>
<p><strong>43:53 Replayed Portal 2</strong></p>
<p>So good!</p>
<p><strong>47:53 Satisfactory</strong></p>
<p>On the show I mentioned that Paul builds circles around me. In my own games, I make incredibly slow progress because I spend a lot of time putting all of my machinery into warehouses and painting them by purpose like so:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>It’s not the most efficient way to build, but… hm. Well, I’m sure all this effort counts for <strong>something</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>54:29 Fallout 76 Repair Kits</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-04-06-fallout-76-players-say-incoming-repair-kits-break-no-pay-to-win-promise">Fallout 76 players say incoming Repair Kits break Bethesda’s no pay-to-win promise</a>.</p>
<p><strong>59:13 Anthem Development story </strong> </p>
<p>It’s a sad tale. Read it for yourself: <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964">How BioWare’s Anthem Went Wrong</a></p>
<p><strong>1:13:19 Mailbag: Anthem Development</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Is there anything Randy Pitchford won’t do for money?  Discuss.</p>
<p>Okay, more constructively:</p>
<p>In the fallout from Kotaku’s exposé of Bioware’s seemingly awful working environment during the Andromeda and Anthem periods, Bioware’s Casey Hudson complained that actual names were named and that this was unfair on those individuals.  Leaving aside the fact that both Bioware and EA were sent the article before publication and declined to comment on it, do you think his position is reasonable?  In a business where staff are stressed and overworked to the point of needing to take entire months of medical leave, and which has now had two high profile failures in as many years, should the people responsible (assuming due diligence on the part of the reporter) really expect to remain anonymous?</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Geebs*</p>
<p>(* the “g” is soft)</p></blockquote>
<p>I had no idea the G was soft. I’ve been silently imagining this name incorrectly for five years.</p>

I don’t want to make too big a deal about this. All I did was close an account. I’m not trying to make some statement and convince the world that we should all abandon Twitter. I don’t care that other people still use it. I was just sickened by the stuff the algorithm promoted and I decided I didn’t need a steady drip of that nonsense. 

I’m having to remember how I followed gaming news in the pre-Twitter days. I have to open up gaming sites directly and scroll through the headlines like some sort of savage. I should probably look and see if Reddit has any aggregation for gaming news. 

19:57 Email Hack 

It was a minor problem that was quickly fixed, but I did lose about 24 hours of email. Still, I do wonder how I lost control of that account. I usually use strong passwords.

23:43 Risk of Rain 2

During the show I talked about how I was working on getting the achievement / unlock for surviving for 20 levels. I got it about 3 hours after we wrapped the show:




I’m kind of sad that I’m basically done with everything for now. I’m having a lot of fun with this one, but I think I’ll shelve it until the devs roll out a few more features. The game is still in early access and there’s supposedly a lot more content on the way.

Also: I did not give Paul accurate information regarding the sealed chamber. Issac informed me that there are a couple of buttons nearby, and you need to press them both at once. It’s trivial to do if you’re playing with a friend, but if you’re playing alone then you have to shove one of the nearby pots onto the switch. This is hard, since the pots are explosive and you’ve usually got people shooting at you. I plan to drop the Engineer’s turret on one of the buttons and see if that counts.

37:34 Cardlife Abandoned 

What a shame. I was planning to pick this up once it started coming together. It’s a fun idea with a great look. But now it’s (apparently) abandoned.

43:53 Replayed Portal 2

So good!

47:53 Satisfactory

On the show I mentioned that Paul builds circles around me. In my own games, I make incredibly slow progress because I spend a lot of time putting all of my machinery into warehouses and painting them by purpose like so:




It’s not the most efficient way to build, but… hm. Well, I’m sure all this effort counts for something.

54:29 Fallout 76 Repair Kits

Fallout 76 players say incoming Repair Kits break Bethesda’s no pay-to-win promise.

59:13 Anthem Development story  

It’s a sad tale. Read it for yourself: How BioWare’s Anthem Went Wrong

1:13:19 Mailbag: Anthem Development

Dear Diecast,
Is there anything Randy Pitchford won’t do for money?  Discuss.
Okay, more constructively:
In the fallout from Kotaku’s exposé of Bioware’s seemingly awful working environment during the Andromeda and Anthem periods, Bioware’s Casey Hudson complained that actual names were named and that this was unfair on those individuals.  Leaving aside the fact that both Bioware and EA were sent the article before publication and declined to comment on it, do you think his position is reasonable?  In a business where staff are stressed and overworked to the point of needing to take entire months of medical leave, and which has now had two high profile failures in as many years, should the people responsible (assumi…</itunes:summary>

<strong>00:00 Shopping for Vehicles</strong></p>
<p>The thing I forgot to mention is that the new car has about double the fuel economy. Our poor minivan was a bit of a lush, and keeping it fueled was enormously expensive. By my rough estimate, the new car will save us about $1,000 a year on fuel alone.</p>
<p><strong>17:52 Broken Peripherals</strong></p>
<p>I’m too lazy to take photos of the new keyboard in situ, but here is one lifted from the store page:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>Given how much of my day I spend typing, getting a new keyboard is a pretty big deal for me.&nbsp;I’m still in the early phase of keyboard adoption where I’m making a lot of mistakes.</p>
<p>The new KB is just different enough from the old that it’s taking some time to adapt. I’m used to a double-height return key. The backslash isn’t where I expect it. I’m used to a gap of empty space between the function keys and everything else. The new keyboard has a new (to me) key that seems to behave like a right-click, and that’s a little weird to my way of thinking. This extra key means the space bar is a little narrower, and I’m not crazy about that. The right control doesn’t work unless you also hold down FN, and I have no idea what that’s all about.</p>
<p>Instead of a user manual, it came with a piece of paper directing me to the website. That’s fine, inasmuch as I’m into saving trees and it’s not worth printing a full manual for a simple keyboard. Except, the website is long gone<span class="snote" title="1">The scrap of paper indicates this unit was made in 2014.</span> and there’s a domain name<span class="snote" title="2">www.eagletech.com</span> squatter on it now. So that’s disappointing. I’ll probably never know why the right Ctrl key behaves this way.</p>
<p>This is the first time since the early 90s that I’ve had a keyboard with clicky-clack mechanical keys. I forgot how loud these things were. It’s really nice for typing, but it’s obnoxious for gaming. The loud clicking is really distracting when you’re trying to immerse yourself in a game.</p>
<p>Also, I forgot how nice it is to have a keyboard with some <strong>weight</strong>. My last keyboard was a bit light and could gradually migrate to the left during a vigorous gaming session, but this new one is rock solid.</p>

<p><strong>50:35 Warframe</strong></p>
<p>Fun story: I was playing Warframe while listening to this part of the show. In the middle of the part where I complained that the game summoned the <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Wolf_of_Saturn_Six">Wolf of Saturn Six</a> during a mission, the game did it again. This time it did so during a low-level early-game mission. I was running away from this end-game boss while listening to a podcast where I complained about exactly this problem.</p>
<p>Like I said on the show, I couldn’t take more than two hits from this guy, I had nothing to slow him down, and it took me several minutes to knock a tiny 5% off his massive health bar. <strong>And that was with my best loadout!</strong> This time I had a low-level frame and some weak weapons, so defeating him was a physical impossibility.</p>
<p>This really is like having Arthas show up in Westfall, running around one-shotting lowbie players. That’s just <strong>atrocious</strong> game design. It’s really confusing for new players who don’t understand what this guy is and have no idea why they’re suddenly dropping dead in the middle of this supposedly low-level mission.</p>
<p><strong>Shamus, maybe the designers are trying to motivate you to level up enough to fight this guy?</strong></p>
<p>Leveling in this game is pretty slow. It would take months of focused play to reach the level where a fight with this guy would make sense. By that time, this event will be long over.</p>
<p>So maybe you’re thinking that it might be fun to get together with a few friends, equip all your best gear, and gang up on him? Wrong. You can’t fight him at will. He just shows up randomly. Given the way this game is designed, you don’t usually walk around with your best gear. Even if you’ve got gear to deal with him, you probably won’t have it equipped when he shows up.</p>
<p>The designers could have saved themselves a ton of money. Instead of wasting time modeling and animating this boss, just add a heart attack feature to the game. Once every four dozen missions, your character keels over dead, you fail your current mission, and there’s nothing you can do about it. It’s functionally the same but a lot easier to implement.</p>
<p>The punchline? He doesn’t even drop anything amazing. Even if you persevere and spend an hour chipping away at that gargantuan health bar without getting murdered, the odds are he’ll drop one-forth of the blueprints for his weapon. According to the wiki, on average you’d need to fight him ~40 times to get all the blueprints. Since you can’t fight him at will, I don’t think that’s possible even if you play around the clock.</p>
<p>The entire system is so stupidly broken and nonsensical I can’t even tell what the designer was <strong>trying</strong> to do.</p>
<p><strong>1:04:46 Free Key for Overload</strong></p>
<p>If you’d like a key for the Descent-like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/448850/Overload/">Overload</a>, then send us a question for the show<span class="snote" title="3">The email is in the header image.</span>. To avoid getting spammed, let me make some rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re only eligible if your question is actually used on the show, so there’s nothing to be gained from sending the same question 10 times.</li>
<li>This also means that there’s nothing to be gained from sending in random <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgqHCFBXc1w#t=1m54s">nonsense questions</a>.</li>
<li>They key I have is for Steam, so ideally you’ll have some sort of Steam account.</li>
<li>Please mention in the message that you’re interested in the Overload key, just so I don’t send the key to someone who doesn’t want it.</li>
<li>This is probably obvious, but the key will be sent to the email used to send the question. So don’t use a bogus / disposable address or you won’t get your prize.</li>

<p>When listening to the show after editing, I became paranoid that someone might take this the wrong way and assume “this show” was referring to the Diecast as a whole, and we were joking that the show was terrible when I was working with the previous hosts. Just to be clear: That’s not what I was laughing about and I don’t want anyone to think I was throwing shade at my former collaborators.</p>
<p><strong>18:52 Mailbag: Worldbuilding and also…</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hey Shamus and Paul,</p>
<p>quick question about world-building; I find reading the background about Elder Scrolls games fascinating even though it has paper-thin characters and plot; conversely I don’t care about the world in games like Dragon Age and find the exposition very dull (even though traditionally Bioware has been much better at characters) how do you feel about the two? do you think there’s a right way and a wrong way to do world-building in a fantasy setting? </p>
<p>I always suspected it was partly down to books being read like books in TES games, rather than essentially an Amazon Kindle like the codex in Dragon Age, but just curious if you have some more thoughts on this (or perhaps it’s just down to TES lore being really really meta)</p>

<p><strong>40:31 Mailbag: Raytracing.</strong>  </p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>

<p>Lachlan</p></blockquote>
<p>In this segment I talked about what graphics hardware I’m using. For the record, I’m using a GeForce GTX 780, which was originally released in 2013. So my graphics hardware turns 6 this year. This is certainly the longest a graphics card has ever lasted for me. </p>
<p>Like I said on the show, I still don’t feel a direct need to upgrade. I’m still using a 1080p monitor, so games look fine and play fine. But I’m considering an upgrade just for the sake of screenshots. I don’t want people to accuse me of being unfair to a game and making it look bad because I’m running it on a potato. </p>
<p>But I don’t think the upgrade is going to happen before summer. We’re a one-car family and our 2003 Toyota just crossed the 200,000 mile threshold. It’s getting really expensive to keep the thing on the road and I’m worried about Heather getting stranded someplace during bad weather. So we have to buy a car before we can buy new graphics hardware.</p>
<p>I know <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=2133">I make fun of how hard it is to shop for graphics hardware</a>, but that’s nothing compared to the stress of buying vehicles. Putting that much money into a single purchase always freaks me out. </p>
<p>So we’re going to have a couple more months of potato-rendered screenshots before I manage to upgrade this thing. Your patience is appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>51:44 Mailbag: Next Console gen.  </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear die casters.</p>
<p>The rumor mill is churning and the reveal of the next console generation draws ever closer. As such, I’d like to ask what you think Sony and Microsoft should do or will do for next gen.</p>
<p>Microsoft have bought a bunch of studios recently, so I think it’s a safe bet that they’ll actually have some video games to sell on their next console. Novel, I know.</p>
<p>Sony on the other hand could very well sit blind on their high horse and blunder through the generation, as they did with the PS3. But if they don’t do that, I hope the rumours of a backwards compatible PS5 is true. Even just PS4 games would be a huge boon for the system. There’s even talk of a console with support for ALL the previous Playstations, which sounds as amazing as it is unlikely.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>
<p>-Victor</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>56:26 Mailbag: Battletech  </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>I’ve been playing Battletech this month.  Because Shamus has also played Battletech (and because you said that the mailbag was empty) I have two very important giant-robot related questions for you.</p>
<p>Question 1:  Gun hands or people hands?</p>
<p>Question 2:  Chicken legs or people legs?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>–John</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>1:00:21 Mailbag: Open-source remakes.  </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast<br>
Have you paid any attention to open-source remakes/clones of old games, such as OpenMW, OpenRA, or OpenXcom? What’s you’re opinion on them and are there any such projects you find particularly interesting, or any games you would particularly want to see remade in this manner? </p>

      <itunes:summary>Last week I asked for mailbag questions, and you delivered. Well, technically the email system is the one that did the delivering, but you get what I’m saying. Here is over an hour of question-answering.


Hosts: Paul, Shamus. Episode edited by Issac.

Show notes:
00:00 The Clocks Change

I have run out of ways to make fun of this annoying practice. How disappointing.

00:59 Mailbag: Gaming literacy

Dear Diecast
Do you think that there is such a thing as “gaming literacy” and if so what would the requirements be to be considered “game literate”?
Regards Eric
As promised on the show, here is… this:




09:24 Mailbag: Uplay  

Dear Diecast,
Shockingly, UPlay has recently become a functional piece of software.  You can now buy (using PayPal, even!), download and execute games with it.  Even with my terrible internet connection, I haven’t had any issues with DRM.  What gives?
Admittedly, the only two things you can actually buy on it are The UbiSoft Game and Uno, so the platform remains a bit limited.
Can you think of any other examples of a program or service, which has been completely worthless for the best part of a decade, suddenly becoming competent?
Best wishes, 
Geebs
During the show, we made a joke that “this show” was an example of something that started out as useless but then became competent. By “this show” I was referring to the specific episode we were recording. Like, it started out as incompetent as evidenced by my butchering of this email.

When listening to the show after editing, I became paranoid that someone might take this the wrong way and assume “this show” was referring to the Diecast as a whole, and we were joking that the show was terrible when I was working with the previous hosts. Just to be clear: That’s not what I was laughing about and I don’t want anyone to think I was throwing shade at my former collaborators.

18:52 Mailbag: Worldbuilding and also…

Hey Shamus and Paul,
quick question about world-building; I find reading the background about Elder Scrolls games fascinating even though it has paper-thin characters and plot; conversely I don’t care about the world in games like Dragon Age and find the exposition very dull (even though traditionally Bioware has been much better at characters) how do you feel about the two? do you think there’s a right way and a wrong way to do world-building in a fantasy setting? 
I always suspected it was partly down to books being read like books in TES games, rather than essentially an Amazon Kindle like the codex in Dragon Age, but just curious if you have some more thoughts on this (or perhaps it’s just down to TES lore being really really meta)
if you’re hurting for another question; we all know about the thermal clip situation in Mass Effect. If you had to retcon a gameplay element of a past game, how would you go about it? Try and brush it under the rug, or just own it and run with it?
many thanks guys,

30:03 Mechanical Retcons.

This question was part of the previous question.

40:31 Mailbag: Raytracing.  

Dear Diecast,
Do you think raytracing on the GPU in going to take off, or merely something Nvidia added to the RTX line to be a technical gimmick for this generation?

<strong>00:00 Suddenly done with Anthem</strong></p>
<p>During this segment, Paul references this talk: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg">Juice it or lose it – a talk by Martin Jonasson &amp; Petri Purho</a>. Here is the same idea conveyed with better audio and production values:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>14:45 Still Playing Warframe</strong></p>
<p>As promised on the show, here is the build I’m using in Warframe:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>For those that don’t play: The two rows of stuff that begin with “Stretch” and “Streamline” are slots where you equip various cards that boost your stats. Redirection boosts my shields by 360%. Fast deflection boosts my shield recharge rate by 90%. Vitality gives me 400% more health. Steel Fiber gives me +80% armor. While the game never explains what armor does, players have told me it’s really important. I assume it reduces damage to hitpoints by some amount. How much? I dunno. <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Armor">Go read the wiki</a>, because the game itself won’t tell you.</p>
<p>You can see there are little glowing blue pips on the cards. You can upgrade the cards. The cost to do so goes up exponentially while the bonus scales linearly. So maybe every level of upgrade will add an additional 20% to (some value) but the cost to do so doubles every time.</p>
<p>This is it. This is the best I’ve been able to do in terms of survivability. I’m as durable as I can get. Yes, I can maybe squeeze another level out of a couple of these cards. The cost to raise even one of these cards would be staggering. Literally days of grinding for the endo resource, which is what is used to upgrade these cards. Even if I did that, it’s not like these last couple of upgrades would be all that game-changing. Increasing my shield boost from +360% to +380% isn’t going to change the result all that much.</p>
<p>Like I said on the show, this boss<span class="snote" title="1">The junction guardian going from Pluto to Sedna.</span> killed me instantly, with a single shot, the moment the fight began, using a hitscan weapon. I hit the button to open the door and then fell over dead before I even saw the bad guy move. The boss pulled this trick several times before I scraped by using blind luck and cheese. </p>
<p>There’s no way to tell how much the boss was OVER killing me. I’ll admit that Mag (the warframe I’m using) isn’t the most durable in the game, but she’s not <strong>that</strong> far behind the others in terms of survivability. I could spend a week grinding for more endo to upgrade my cards and find he was still one-shotting me. At the very best, doing the full round of upgrades might allow me to survive a single shot. Maybe switching to the most durable frame I have might let me take two shots. That’s still ridiculous in terms of a fight against an AI with a hitscan weapon in an open arena.</p>
<p>I don’t know. Maybe this is what the designer intended. Maybe I’m not supposed to be going after this content just yet. Maybe there’s some secret mystery card out there that will vastly improve my survivability. The difficulty of this game is all over the place. Nothing in any of the previous missions indicated I was getting in over my head.</p>
<p>This is such a stubbornly obtuse game. </p>
<p>On the other hand, Warframe isn’t boring. Not like that other game. The one that just came out. What was it called again? Anaheim or something?</p>
<p><strong>22:12 Mailbag: Sony’s Handheld Misadventures</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast</p>
<p>With rumours of the Xbox Gamepass coming to the Nintendo Switch should Sony consider re-entering the handheld market?  Is it worth the risk for Sony to build a successor to the PS Vita or consider making the PS5 a hybrid console?  Or would it be better for them to leave the market to Nintendo and Microsoft? </p>
<p>Regards </p>

<p>Here are <a href="http://peripheralarbor.com/gallery/v/CG+Art/scripts/crystal/">some renders of the crystal structures Paul made</a>.</p>
<p><strong>48:33 Mailbag: Simulationist approach to game design.  </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi!</p>
<p>2/10 stars question.</p>
<p>I got an itch to replay old and very niche games (Brigade E5 and 7.62mm), since there were nothing like them to this day (even close). They are very simulationist hardcore tactical strategies (think X-Com and Jagged Alliance 2 but with real-time with smart pause) that placed realism of all interactions above all else (a small example, getting a clip from a pocket is 2.35 seconds faster than getting a same clip from a backpack; all these rules applies to enemies as well). Of course, it means that these games aren’t really friendly, like recent XCOM games, and it would take a lot of time, patience and quickloads to finish them. So my question is – is there a merit in going against getting fun/balanced/polished gameplay all the way to a practically complete 1-to-1 realism (to expand to other games, think ArmA, SWAT4, Richard Burns Rally, etc)? What would be gained from this, in your eyes, and what would be lost?</p>

<p>Show notes: <span id="more-46022"></span><br>
<strong>00:00 Shamus stopped playing Warframe</strong></p>
<p>I tried. I checked the wiki. I looked on Youtube. I searched the forums. I didn’t find anything that would let me clear the Pluto junction without having to do the dumb spy mission. Maybe I’ll get the itch to play through that at some point, but I’m shelving the game for now. I’ll probably come back when the <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Wisp_(PH)">Wisp</a> Warframe is released.</p>
<p><strong>19:59 Anthem is Officially out!</strong></p>
<p>I’m having a good time with it for now, but the whole thing is pretty watered down. If the splash screen logo didn’t tell me this was a BioWare game, I never would have guessed it.</p>
<p>I looked on YouTube and I couldn’t find the particular trailer Paul was talking about. (There are a lot of trailers!) The closest thing I could find was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wka5RovFEo8">this thing</a> from Hollywood director Neill Blomkamp (District 9) which is indeed pretty cool, but had absolutely nothing to do with anything that happens or is talked about in the game.</p>
<p><strong>40:22 Mailbag: Technical debt and the case for software sustainers</strong>  </p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>While browsing LinkedIn I happened across <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/renewed-case-software-sustaining-bj-black/">a series of articles which I thought you might find interesting</a>.</p>
<p>The author presents a notion that throughout the development cycle, software is created, sustained for a while, and eventually destroyed and replaced, and that the creation phase leads to the accumulation of what he calls technical debt (e.g. the costs of maintaining the code, fixing bugs, providing customer support etc.).</p>
<p>He then points out that the tech industry tends to put creators (developers) on the pedestal while marginalizing the work done by sustainers and destroyers (QA, DevOps, support etc.), often to the detriment of the final product, as the technical debt becomes overwhelming.</p>
<p>The series has immediately reminded me of Shamus’s writing style, so I’m sending it over on a hunch, in case you guys had any experiences that would go in line with or against the notions presented in the articles, or simply find the subject matter worth discussing.</p>
<p>Lots of love,<br>
Pawe?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>50:13 Mailbag: Nintendo with a more common console?</strong>  </p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast</p>
<p>Nintendo is a very large and very successful company and they are currently doing very well with Switch.  However do you think that if Nintendo had been more conventional, more open to risks and new ideas they could be even more successful than they are today?  </p>
<p>(By conventional I mean less of a gimmicky approach to hardware, better third party support, more first party games in popular genres, more adult orientated games, less draconian views on streaming, etc.)</p>
<p>Regards </p>
<p>Eric</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>1:01:49 Mailbag: Andromeda setting.</strong>  </p>
<blockquote><p>Hi!</p>
<p>3 out of 10 question</p>
<p>I’ve started ME Andromeda (can’t just read your series), and while I agree with your assessment of writing, I actually have another gripe with it. Not sure, how legitimate is it, and don’t think I saw anyone bringing it up. May be I’m wrong and just imagined all this? I think the premise of you being a pathfinder, exploring new worlds for colonization in another galaxy, is wrong for the Mass Effect setting. If anything, that promise of finding new planets and exploring them more suited for the Milky Way (which was shown in Mass Effect 1), with mostly closed mass relays.</p>
<p>Andromeda didn’t suffer Reaper cycles (I hope), her civilizations had millennia to advance. Arcs should’ve arrived and find themselves in active gala-political (?) scape, with major powers having tech at least rivaling the Reapers, and minor ones, being lower than Milky Way species. It could’ve been unstable Cold War-like situation, which would become even more unstable with guests from Milky Way.</p>
<p>I know its a fanfic level of writing I’ve just displayed, but it bothers me to no end, that writers didn’t capitalize on main in-setting difference between galaxies. On the other hand, considering the level of writing in Andromeda, may be its for the best, that they decided to take way less ambitious route with the premise.</p>
<p>Best regards, DeadlyDark</p></blockquote>
<p>In this section I mentioned my Andromeda retrospective and talked about “last week’s entry”. Looking at the blog, I now see that the post I was referring to is the one that will go up <strong>tomorrow</strong>. Sorry, this gets confusing for me. For me there’s the post that you’re commenting on, the posts that are about to go live, and the future posts I’m currently writing / proofing. Sometime I lose track of what’s made it to the front page. </p>
<p>Barring any major re-writes, the final Andromeda entry will appear on April 9. After that, I’m thinking about doing a series on programming languages.</p>

Show notes: 
00:00 Shamus stopped playing Warframe

I tried. I checked the wiki. I looked on Youtube. I searched the forums. I didn’t find anything that would let me clear the Pluto junction without having to do the dumb spy mission. Maybe I’ll get the itch to play through that at some point, but I’m shelving the game for now. I’ll probably come back when the Wisp Warframe is released.

19:59 Anthem is Officially out!

I’m having a good time with it for now, but the whole thing is pretty watered down. If the splash screen logo didn’t tell me this was a BioWare game, I never would have guessed it.

I looked on YouTube and I couldn’t find the particular trailer Paul was talking about. (There are a lot of trailers!) The closest thing I could find was this thing from Hollywood director Neill Blomkamp (District 9) which is indeed pretty cool, but had absolutely nothing to do with anything that happens or is talked about in the game.

40:22 Mailbag: Technical debt and the case for software sustainers  

Dear Diecast,
While browsing LinkedIn I happened across a series of articles which I thought you might find interesting.
The author presents a notion that throughout the development cycle, software is created, sustained for a while, and eventually destroyed and replaced, and that the creation phase leads to the accumulation of what he calls technical debt (e.g. the costs of maintaining the code, fixing bugs, providing customer support etc.).
He then points out that the tech industry tends to put creators (developers) on the pedestal while marginalizing the work done by sustainers and destroyers (QA, DevOps, support etc.), often to the detriment of the final product, as the technical debt becomes overwhelming.
The series has immediately reminded me of Shamus’s writing style, so I’m sending it over on a hunch, in case you guys had any experiences that would go in line with or against the notions presented in the articles, or simply find the subject matter worth discussing.
Lots of love,
Pawe?
50:13 Mailbag: Nintendo with a more common console?  

Dear Diecast
Nintendo is a very large and very successful company and they are currently doing very well with Switch.  However do you think that if Nintendo had been more conventional, more open to risks and new ideas they could be even more successful than they are today?  
(By conventional I mean less of a gimmicky approach to hardware, better third party support, more first party games in popular genres, more adult orientated games, less draconian views on streaming, etc.)
Regards 
Eric
1:01:49 Mailbag: Andromeda setting.  

Hi!
3 out of 10 question
I’ve started ME Andromeda (can’t just read your series), and while I agree with your assessment of writing, I actually have another gripe with it. Not sure, how legitimate is it, and don’t think I saw anyone bringing it up. May be I’m wrong and just imagined all this? I think the premise of you being a pathfinder, exploring new worlds for colonization in another galaxy, is wrong for the Mass Effect setting. If anything, that promise of finding new planets and exploring them more suited for the Milky Way (which was shown in Mass Effect 1), with mostly closed mass relays.
Andromeda didn’t suffer Reaper cycles (I hope), her civilizations had millennia to advance. Arcs should’ve arrived and find themselves in active gala-political (?) scape, with major powers having tech at least rivaling the Reapers, and minor ones, being lower than Milky Way species. It could’ve been unstable Cold War-like situation, which would become even more unstable with guests from Milky Way.
I know its a fanfic level of writing I’ve just displayed, but it bothers me to no end, that writers didn’t capitalize on main in-setting difference between galaxies. On the other h…</itunes:summary>

48:47 Mailbag: Fan feedback vs. entitlement

Hello members of the council of the Diecast,
In December of last year. The devs of Spider-Man PS4 got into a conversation on Twitter regarding the inclusion of the Raimi suit in the then upcoming DLC. The ensuing conversation was a back and forth between Spider-Man fans who expressed hope and concern about the Raimi suit’s inclusion, and Insomniac supporters who pushed back against what was starting to sound like bitter fan entitlement.
I got into a conversation with a friend about this last week and my perspective is that video games are just like any other product. A company/people/developer etc. is offering you a service, you buy that service and so, it is basic capitalism. Whoever is selling needs to know the wishes of the public and tune their product accordingly. After all, you don’t want your product to be something nobody wants or sells poorly.
Obviously, there are many exceptions to this sort of thinking. Think F2P games or Games which don’t recieve DLC or other content (this is rare nowadays). And there is a difference between ‘asking’ for changes or additions to a game, and demanding them, obviously.
My question is:
How large do you think the role of the consumer should be when it comes to offering feedback or suggesting additions/changes to a video game that they bought before it becomes unreasonable (eg demanding Nintendo put guns and gore in Zelda games).
Sincerely and apologies for the long question,
Lucas

<p>Show notes:<span id="more-45620"></span><br>
<strong>00:00 DeepMind – The learning AI for Starcraft</strong></p>
<p>Since recording this, I’ve watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUTMhmVh1qs">the DeepMind show match between the AI and a couple of pro players</a>. I think I’ll cover this topic in my column next week.</p>
<p><strong>05:27 Chainmail Bikini Will Return</strong></p>
<p>Like I said on the show, I don’t want to back-date them into the archives. At the same time, I don’t want to post them three times a week or they’ll drown out the rest of the content. Having thought about this some more, I think I’ll be posting the comics once a week, on Sundays.</p>
<p><strong>07:30 Paul introduced his kids to Portal</strong></p>
<p>As an aside, here’s a reference to <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/comicsandcosplay/comics/stolen-pixels/8104-Stolen-Pixels-226-Chime-Chime-Chime">the Chime problem I had</a>.</p>
<p><strong>14:51 Anthem First Impressions</strong></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>In the public reception of Anthem, I was hoping for one of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A return to form for BioWare, taking their classic worldbuilding and blending it with modern looter-shooter gameplay.</li>
<li>A buggy disjointed disaster of a game with an embarrassing story and terrible gameplay that punishes the studio for dumping their longtime fans to chase the shooter market.</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead, it looks like we’re getting the least interesting result. From the the first impressions, it sounds like Anthem is competent but ordinary. It will probably carve out a modest chunk of the Destiny / Warframe market and coast along as a perfectly serviceable entry in the genre. (Until EA closes it down in disappointment because it didn’t make a billion dollars.)</p>
<p><strong>22:15 Fallout 76 Multiplayer System</strong></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>I keep promising myself that I’ll stop covering this game because there’s no point in beating a dead horse. But damn it, this dead horse was so smug and entitled that I just can’t resist a few more swings.</p>
<p><strong>30:13 Windows 10 on Old Computers</strong></p>

<p><strong>43:05 Mailbag: Measuring Story Quality</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi!</p>
<p>With all this recent talk about stories, plot-holes and their impact on the quality of said stories, it got me thinking… So, ok, contrivance’s or plot-hole’s impact is negative on the story. But lets imagine there are two stories of equal length, both without plot-holes (for example, they say Alien and The Thing are both without plot holes, and roughly of equal length). What metrics could be used to measure which story is better? I have few ideas (one of them listed below), but I want to hear your (podcast members) take on it as well</p>
<p>I also has another idea (which is more applicable more to movies, than anything else, I gather). So, there are movies with relatively thin plot, but their strength is in great action scenes, that are enabled by said plot (let’s say, Predator, The Raid or half the Jackie Chan movies). So, when I thought about first question, one of the potential metric that popped up in my head, is the amount and the intensity of conflicts presented in the story per time unit. Individual action scene is the short story on itself, isn’t it? I can show you, say, the plane scene in Octopussy, where Bond (and the stuntman) climbs on top the plane and you’ll get the complete idea what’s happening, what’s in stake and how it will affect Bond if he fails. And good action scene is always about how tense the situation for the hero, and bad ones, outside of bad cinematography, have little danger for the protagonist (as an example, in SPECTRE, Bond shoots bad guys in villain’s lair with so much ease, its boring). So, the popular opinion (I think), is that plot in these movies is weak or not great or not worth mentioning. But I’m starting to think that this is the other way around. If the main story enables the writer to give you such amount of tense and inventive visual mini-stories (Bond on the plane, Bond runs on alligators, Bond climbing the mountain and someone cuts his rope), isn’t it the sign of great storytelling? I’m not sure myself yet, but I think that’s an interesting idea to explore.</p>
<p>Best regards, DeadlyDark</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>56:26 Mailbag: 7/10 Scores</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast</p>
<p>I have noticed a trend of inflation when it comes to game review scores.  These days even a review score of 7/10 is considered rather poor.  What do you think is the cause of this and do you think there is a way to fix this?</p>
<p>Regards Eric</p></blockquote>

Show notes:
00:00 DeepMind – The learning AI for Starcraft

Since recording this, I’ve watched the DeepMind show match between the AI and a couple of pro players. I think I’ll cover this topic in my column next week.

05:27 Chainmail Bikini Will Return

Like I said on the show, I don’t want to back-date them into the archives. At the same time, I don’t want to post them three times a week or they’ll drown out the rest of the content. Having thought about this some more, I think I’ll be posting the comics once a week, on Sundays.

07:30 Paul introduced his kids to Portal

As an aside, here’s a reference to the Chime problem I had.

14:51 Anthem First Impressions




In the public reception of Anthem, I was hoping for one of two things:


A return to form for BioWare, taking their classic worldbuilding and blending it with modern looter-shooter gameplay.
A buggy disjointed disaster of a game with an embarrassing story and terrible gameplay that punishes the studio for dumping their longtime fans to chase the shooter market.

Instead, it looks like we’re getting the least interesting result. From the the first impressions, it sounds like Anthem is competent but ordinary. It will probably carve out a modest chunk of the Destiny / Warframe market and coast along as a perfectly serviceable entry in the genre. (Until EA closes it down in disappointment because it didn’t make a billion dollars.)

22:15 Fallout 76 Multiplayer System




I keep promising myself that I’ll stop covering this game because there’s no point in beating a dead horse. But damn it, this dead horse was so smug and entitled that I just can’t resist a few more swings.

30:13 Windows 10 on Old Computers

<p>You most likely already have read the news about Ubisoft moving their games from Steam to Epic store. Shamus seems pretty positive about Epic store because of “competition is always good”. But for me it looks like rather bad thing happening right now to PC gaming. Epic doesn’t compete with Steam for customers, it competes for developers, and the customers are just getting screwed in the process, because they are forced to use obviously inferior (in terms of features) store. No reviews, no forums, no tags, no big picture, no controller customization, no time played tracking and so on. Steam developed shitton of features over the years which it didn’t have to (because of having no competitors). Why would you think that Epic would do the same? They have the games exclusively on their store and it’s enough to force the customer that want to play them to use it. Epic haven’t promised any features other than user reviews (opt in for publisher!). Origin and Uplay exist for years and they have zero of Steam features. Isn’t it likely that we end up with Epic store as the same shitty but cross-publisher store? For me it looks more about corporate greed than any consumer benefits. Epic has billions of profits from Fortnite which they want to invest in getting cut from every pc game sale, and publishers want to have bigger share of revenue. Customers are just would be forced to live with what corporations allow them.</p>

<p>I notice we keep having this discussion, and I’m not sure how to break us out of this loop. Let me try an analogy:</p>
<p>A sports team comes up with a new strategy. Say the Zanarkand Abes invent a new passing strategy. Suddenly they begin scoring goals in situations where teams usually couldn’t score. This is a good strategy. It makes the game more interesting. This strategy might be adopted by other teams and mix things up.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the Zanarkand Abes are the best team, or even that they deserve to win the title. They might be a terrible team with bad players, but this move they invented still has value. In a league where one team wins all the time, anything that disrupts the status quo is good.</p>
<p>Yes, the Epic platform might ruin a few titles. Maybe it will turn out the platform never adds basic features. But that still could be less overall damage to the industry than having everything ruled by a single hegemonic storefront. Consider two numbers:</p>
<p>A: The number of titles that would have made money if they were only paying a 12% royalty fee, but who lost money with a 30% royalty fee. These teams will either disband or choose not to make a sequel.</p>
<p>B: The number of games that wind up being exclusive to the Epic games store.</p>
<p>If A is greater than B, then Epic’s move is overall good for games <strong>even if they never improve their storefront</strong>. On top of this, I think a game being tied to a single horrible storefront is less of a tragedy than a game not getting made at all. This is particularly true in the case of under-served markets and niche games.</p>
<p>That said, I’m actually pinning my hopes on Discord and GoG.</p>

<strong>00:00 Into the Spider-Verse</strong></p>
<p>It’s a spoiler discussion, so if you’re not into that then jump to…</p>
<p><strong>24:17 Activision lost their CFO this week. Twice.</strong></p>
<p>First <a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/netflix-spencer-neumann-cfo-1203097647/amp/">they lost Spencer Neumann to Netflix</a>, and a few days later <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tn-square-amrita-ahuja-20190103-story.html?outputType=amp">they lost Amrita Ahuja to Square</a>.</p>
<p><strong>33:20 Who has time to talk about: Fallout 76 Multiplayer system?</strong></p>
<p>The first step in fixing a problem is admitting you have one.</p>
<p><strong>33:38 Mailbag: Microsoft game Engine</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>So, I had this crazy idea and I’m curious to see what you’d think of it.</p>
<p>If Microsoft is seriously looking at moving into gaming as a cross-platform thing, it occurs to me that one big step they could make would be to create their own game engine for the use of the developers they’re acquiring, and also to license out to other developers.  I mean, from what I understand that could be a BIG move for them that would have a HUGE impact on the industry.  I’ve heard it said that Microsoft is amazing at designing tools for software developers, and that would really leverage their “core competency” and put them in a position to have much broader effects on the games industry than they would just by buying games developers and selling gaming systems.</p>
<p>What do you guys think?</p>

<p><strong>39:16 Mailbag: Games that miss the mark.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>When it comes to games that miss the mark, what is the worst or most painful combination in your eyes?  A game with an excellent story/characters/writing but bad mechanics/gameplay, or a game with excellent mechanics/gameplay and a bad story/characters/writing?

<p><strong>46:15 Mailbag: Dragon Age Inquisition</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi!</p>
<p>I’m playing Dragon Age Inquisition right now, and one thing that bothers me a lot (besides one sidequest bug) is that we are playing as the head of organization are running around doing stuff expanding influence, claiming land and gaining favors (I’m doing everything there, because I just can’t left things; I know I have a problem). But our opposing force (cultists + Coripheus) aren’t as proactive. We are stopping their plan in the region, and that’s it, no retaliation (unless you go and do main plot, I suspect). It feels like chess is played only by me, and the opponent is skipping his turns.  That aspect should’ve been done not via standard rpg questing in huge maps with copy-paste side content and such, but via some kind of strategy level management (a-la expanded X-Com or simplified Civilization or Crusader Kings; I think King Arthur games combined story driven rpg with strategy), with occasional mission only for Inquisitor. That would change the genre, but would fit the story way more (not that story is bad, actually I’m surprised that its better than I expected). Older games didn’t have that disconnect. In KOTOR / Mass Effect you’re basically small infiltration team and your gains are intelligence and nothing more. In DAO you’re opposing mindless force, so it makes sense that it isn’t that proactive (and even then it was shown expanding its territory).</p>
<p>Have you noticed that? Do you think that genre change would’ve make DAI better? Any other commentary on this?</p>

Show notes: 
00:00 Into the Spider-Verse

It’s a spoiler discussion, so if you’re not into that then jump to…

24:17 Activision lost their CFO this week. Twice.

First they lost Spencer Neumann to Netflix, and a few days later they lost Amrita Ahuja to Square.

33:20 Who has time to talk about: Fallout 76 Multiplayer system?

The first step in fixing a problem is admitting you have one.

33:38 Mailbag: Microsoft game Engine

So, I had this crazy idea and I’m curious to see what you’d think of it.
If Microsoft is seriously looking at moving into gaming as a cross-platform thing, it occurs to me that one big step they could make would be to create their own game engine for the use of the developers they’re acquiring, and also to license out to other developers.  I mean, from what I understand that could be a BIG move for them that would have a HUGE impact on the industry.  I’ve heard it said that Microsoft is amazing at designing tools for software developers, and that would really leverage their “core competency” and put them in a position to have much broader effects on the games industry than they would just by buying games developers and selling gaming systems.
What do you guys think?

39:16 Mailbag: Games that miss the mark.

Dear Diecast,
When it comes to games that miss the mark, what is the worst or most painful combination in your eyes?  A game with an excellent story/characters/writing but bad mechanics/gameplay, or a game with excellent mechanics/gameplay and a bad story/characters/writing?  Of those two, which would be more disappointing to you?
And on the same note, are there any exceptions to your answer that you can think of out of the games you’ve played in the past, where that element was strong enough that it kept you interested to the end (and maybe even happy) despite its flaws?
Best,
Marcus Virgil
46:15 Mailbag: Dragon Age Inquisition

Hi!
I’m playing Dragon Age Inquisition right now, and one thing that bothers me a lot (besides one sidequest bug) is that we are playing as the head of organization are running around doing stuff expanding influence, claiming land and gaining favors (I’m doing everything there, because I just can’t left things; I know I have a problem). But our opposing force (cultists + Coripheus) aren’t as proactive. We are stopping their plan in the region, and that’s it, no retaliation (unless you go and do main plot, I suspect). It feels like chess is played only by me, and the opponent is skipping his turns.  That aspect should’ve been done not via standard rpg questing in huge maps with copy-paste side content and such, but via some kind of strategy level management (a-la expanded X-Com or simplified Civilization or Crusader Kings; I think King Arthur games combined story driven rpg with strategy), with occasional mission only for Inquisitor.

In KOTOR / Mass Effect you’re basically small infiltration team and your gains are intelligence and nothing more. In DAO you’re opposing mindless force, so it makes sense that it isn’t that proactive (and even then it was shown expanding its territory).

<p><strong>57:52 Mailbag: Can’t keep up with all these new games!</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hello, Keepers of Castle Diecastle.</p>
<p>It hit me that even though I haven’t played every game I want to play yet, I still feel like I have a rough idea about what most games are about. Compare this to every other medium, where I only know about the really popular stuff and have no idea where to even begin finding something of quality that’s lesser known.</p>
<p>With gaming being such a young medium, it’s in this unique position where many people alive today grew up alongside it. But with the indie explosion underway, my grip on gaming just isn’t sustainable.</p>
<p>What do you think the march of time will do to the discourse when we’ll have more and more adults who haven’t played games released before the year 2000 and you can’t even fool yourself into thinking that you can keep track of everything that’s popular?</p>

<p><strong>1:04:20 Mailbag: Will VR rise again?</strong></p>

The best games in all the time were those Occulus gave out for free (Farlands, Robo Recall). I also bought a few games, but mos of them weren’t much fun. (Except Project Cars with a driving wheel)<br>
Shamus had the DK2. Have you had a similar experience? Have you ever considered getting the full version or PS VR?<br>
What could possibly rise the interest again?</p>

<p><strong>1:13:18 Mailbag: Best project of 2018?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi!</p>
<p>End of the year question for podcast. So, out of all the things you published/done this year, which makes you proud the most? And the least?</p>
<p>Best regards, DeadlyDark</p></blockquote>
<p>Allow me to take this opportunity to <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?page_id=45100">plug my book</a>. Also, I created a static page for my book <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?page_id=45100">here on the blog</a>. Every post or page is given a unique ID. You can see it in the URL. This post has an ID of 45232, which is why you see /?p=45232 at the end of the URL. By random chance, the page for my book wound up with the ID of 45100. This is the first code given to the player in System Shock 2, and serves as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAtAyycx-uY">451 callback</a> for the game. I began my transition to writing with my first book, which was a novelization of the first System Shock game.</p>
<p>So by random chance the ID of the page of my latest book matches the door code in the videogame sequel to the game that inspired me to become a writer in the first place. I realize this is just a very minor coincidence, but every time I see that 45100 at the top my brain starts screaming at me that ALL OF THIS MEANS SOMETHING.</p>
<p>If it does mean anything, it probably means I need to get out more.</p>
<p><strong>1:18:16 Mailbag: Unity Dev Series</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear uncle Shamus,</p>
<p>I have recently come upon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMakingOfGames/comments/34qogp/return_of_the_obra_dinn_development_blog_updates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this reddit thread</span></a> with links to Lucas Pope’s updates on developing Obra Dinn and wrestling with Unity to bring his vision to life.</p>
<p>They are not terribly in depth, but I figured you would find them interesting regardless.</p>
<p>Wasting your time from Italy,<br>
Steven</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s it for 2018, everyone. Be safe. See you next year.</p>

I recently discovered that Netflix has a stripped-down version of Minecraft: Story Mode available to play, at least on the computer version of the platform.

<p>After recording this episode, I checked out Minecraft Story Mode on Netflix. It is indeed a “choose your own adventure” kind of deal.

		<p>For whatever reason, my audio is blown out in this episode. I have no idea why. I checked it on my end before we started recording and the levels looked good. This happened a couple of weeks ago and I’m not sure where this is going wrong. It’s amazing that I’ve made 235 of these silly things and I’m still running into new ways that things can fall apart.</p>
<p>I should add that I have my audio going into my headphones and it sounds just fine. The levels coming from the microphone looked reasonable. But somewhere between the microphone and the final recording is a bit of software that’s decided to “help” me a little too much. I was forcibly updated to a new version of Windows a couple of weeks ago. That update is my first suspect, if only because that’s the only thing to have changed recently. I did find a volume slider set to 100%<span class="snote" title="1">I seem to recall that the slider in Windows audio settings use the convention that 50% is full volume and everything above that is software boosting. I can’t find any confirmation of this.</span>, but that doesn’t explain why the levels were fine last week.</p>
<p>I don’t know how people produce regular video content without losing their minds. I feel like every year adds a few more layers of abstraction between me and the hardware.</p>
<p>My voice really is terrible in this one. Sorry. I’d scrap the whole thing, but this episode is a chat with SoldierHawke and we don’t get those very often.</p>
<p>To compensate for this bad sound, I suggest listening to the show in a noisy old car with blown out speakers while driving very fast on a busy highway with the windows down while a truck shadows your blind spot. That should fully mask the audio problems by hiding it under many other audio problems. Also, the constant danger will probably make the show more exciting. Good luck!</p>

<p>Like I said in the show, I’m very curious what other Half-Life 2 fans thought of this game.</p>
<p><strong>16:54 Borderlands 3 No-Show</strong></p>
<p>The longer we go without any sort of announcement, the more I’m afraid this project has gotten away from them and turned into a bloated unfocused mess. Issac (the editor on this show) is a huge <em>Borderlands 2</em> fan and every week for the last year we’ve had the “Any Borderlands 3 news yet?” conversation. </p>
<p><strong>24:23 The Outer Worlds</strong></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>I’m really sorry I dumped on the looks of this game during this segment. To be clear, those comments were based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3cRpYGVPsU">this game informer preview</a> and <strong>not</strong> the trailer. Also, that footage is still pre-release. </p>
<p>Overall, the game is really attractive. Sure, the lip sync is occasionally janky and the faces occupy that weird spot alongside <em>Mass Effect Andromeda</em> where you can’t always tell if it’s supposed to be stylized or not. But this shouldn’t be a problem. Facial animation is not as important as good writing, detailed worldbuilding, solid pacing, consistent characterization, engaging dialog, coherent direction and clear presentation. Going by the trailer, this game has it where it counts.</p>
<p>But for whatever reason, the gaming press is always really hard on Obsidian about their visuals. Bethesda puts out a game with stiff, potato-faced mannequins and shit writing and the world drowns them in awards. Then Obsidian comes in and uses the exact same engine and art assets to make a game that’s ten times smarter and everyone sneers at them for the crappy visuals. </p>
<p>Which is to say: I’m not really faulting the visuals in this game, I’m just worrying that the visuals will harm the game in terms of critical reception. </p>

<p><strong>40:33 Subjectivity and Labeling Opinions</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi!</p>
<p>I think you saw this video already (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu8u2SxarEE). You’ll probably comment on this, considering that the topic is close to you.</p>
<p>If you decide to do it, just try not to apply this to JA or talk about him specifically, since it’s a bit of contagious right now (and I respect you that much, so I’d warn you stay away from potential e-drama; I mean, you’d probably piece it together while reading comments, but I’ll save you some time). If you want a short version, JA made a SOMA video, Mauler when he made his (very good itself, even if my opinion is closer to JA’s) series about Amnesia/SOMA, where he did some digs about some of JA’s quotes, and his somewhat… abrasive style (I can say i feels more on light hearted side, and not like he wishes ill will on people he comments, but you know how people read into this), well, people as a result put one against the other (though, Mauler told some positives about JA in other stuff). It returned with JA’s video about horror games, and Mauler made a 3 hour stream (IIRC, it called EFAP), with friends, where they vivisected JA’s video (granted, it could’ve been done better, but I don’t mind, since I get his idea). And now this JA’s video about objectivity looks more like a passive-agressive answer to Mauler and his fans (JA didn’t mention him directly, or acknowledged Mauler publicly, but it’s 70% likely that that’s the case). So… Be careful. I do hope that these two found a common ground and talk with each other, since I respect both of them</p>

<p><strong>50:35 Learning to Code</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecastles,</p>
<p>My son is 11 years old, plays Minecraft all day, and is really into the command block/programming side of the game. He has dabbled with Scratch a fair bit, but wants to move on to more standard programming. He has taken an interest in coding with C++, C#, or Python.</p>
<p>How does he get started with making things with these programming languages? What does he need on his computer to get started? Is there one language that he should learn first?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p><strong>1:02:34 Optical Drives vs. Physical Media</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast</p>
<p>The other day I was having an argument with someone regarding the relevancy of physical media in relation to modern PC gaming.  My argument was that most gamers who build a new PC opt out of having an optical drive because there is no reason for it and that even some of the biggest modern releases such as Assassin’s Creed Oddessy don’t even bother with a physical release.</p>
<p>This raises the question when last did you use a physical disk to install a new game and how often to you even use your optical drive.  </p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Eric</p></blockquote>
<p>Back in 2006 <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=169">I predicted</a> that going all-digital wouldn’t happen because it can’t replicate shopping as passtime / social activity. Now it looks like I was wrong.</p>
<p>Note that this hasn’t happened to music or movies. Both of those products still have a strong physical presence in stores and neither of them have these ridiculous ownership problems. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_(They_Might_Be_Giants_album)">Flood</a> came out 28 years ago, but I own it and I don’t have to authenticate with some remote server to listen to the music. I don’t have to log into 20th Century Fox to watch my physical copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Hard">Die Hard</a>. </p>
<p>Are the publishers moving away from physical disks because consumers don’t want them, or are they pushing digital sales because they want more control? Is this a rational financial decision, or an uninformed move by people who don’t understand the consumer’s needs?</p>

If you want a short version, JA made a SOMA video, Mauler when he made his (very good itself, even if my opinion is closer to JA’s) series about Amnesia/SOMA, where he did some digs about some of JA’s quotes, and his somewhat… abrasive style (I can say i feels more on light hearted side, and not like he wishes ill will on people he comments, but you know how people read into this), well, people as a result put one against the other (though, Mauler told some positives about JA in other stuff). It returned with JA’s video about horror games, and Mauler made a 3 hour stream (IIRC, it called EFAP), with friends, where they vivisected JA’s video (granted, it could’ve been done better, but I don’t mind, since I get his idea). And now this JA’s video about objectivity looks more like a passive-agressive answer to Mauler and his fans (JA didn’t mention him directly, or acknowledged Mauler publicly, but it’s 70% likely that that’s the case). So… Be careful. I do hope that these two found a common ground and talk with each other, since I respect both of them

50:35 Learning to Code

Dear Diecastles,
My son is 11 years old, plays Minecraft all day, and is really into the command block/programming side of the game. He has dabbled with Scratch a fair bit, but wants to move on to more standard programming. He has taken an interest in coding with C++, C#, or Python.
How does he get started with making things with these programming languages? What does he need on his computer to get started? Is there one language that he should learn first?

1:02:34 Optical Drives vs. Physical Media

Dear Diecast
The other day I was having an argument with someone regarding the relevancy of physical media in relation to modern PC gaming.  My argument was that most gamers who build a new PC opt out of having an optical drive because there is no reason for it and that even some of the biggest modern releases such as Assassin’s Creed Oddessy don’t even bother with a physical release.
This raises the question when last did you use a physical disk to install a new game and how often to you even use your optical drive.  
Regards
Eric
Back in 2006 I predicted that going all-digital wouldn’t happen because it can’t replicate shopping as passtime / social activity. Now it looks like I was wrong.

Note that this hasn’t happened to music or movies. Both of those products still have a strong physical presence in stores and neither of them have these ridiculous ownership problems. Flood came out 28 years ago, but I own it and I don’t have to authenticate with some remote server to listen to the music. I don’t have to log into 20th Century Fox to watch my physical copy of Die Hard. 

Are the publishers moving away from physical disks because consumers don’t want them, or are they pushing digital sales because they want more control? Is this a rational financial decision, or an uninformed move by people who don’t understand th…</itunes:summary>

<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>I have read Shamus’ columns regarding the EA, lootboxes, marketing and the state of the gaming industry in general.  I found his takes to be collected and insightful in an realm that I think is often fraught with misunderstanding.  What I would like to ask the diecast is whether they have paid much attention to Paradox Interactive games and their policy of neverending DLC.  </p>
<p>As you likely know, Paradox publishes and develops Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis, Stellaris, and Hearts of Iron.  As a simple example of their business policy, look at Crusader Kings II.  CK2 was released in 2012 and as of this writing has just short of $300 worth of DLC and a new large expansion is planned to be release this coming week, nearly seven years since its original release.  This seems like it creates a weird situation for buyers; if you’re buying the game today, you’re not going to want to buy all the DLC and you might feel like you’re being cheated having all these features locked behind paywalls (about half the characters are unplayable without two of the DLCs).  That said, I bought CK2 at release and really enjoyed it and playing the game today without DLC is really a more expansive game than it was at release.</p>
<p>A cynic could say that Paradox should have released a “finished” game back in 2012, but I personally am always satisfied with their updates and am happy to pay for them to keep them coming (for CK2 and Stellaris, anyway).  What’s your take on all this?  Are there some perspectives I’m missing?</p>

<p>Amazingly enough, this demo showcases elements similar to No Man’s Sky, except it’s running at 60 FPS on a PS2 and was made 2001. It’s rough, but you can take off in a space ship and traverse into space without any loading screens. The terrain is preset, but was created using procedural generation. </p>
<p>Now for my questions: </p>
<p>What do you think of the demo in comparison to No Man’s Sky knowing the hardware they’re each running on?</p>
<p>With this technical achievement in mind, do you think the industry has moved on from letting coding wizards optimize games to the very limit of consoles due to the increased demand of content and the reality of making games at modern graphical fidelity? And if so, what do you think could be done with modern hardware given enough time?</p>
<p>Cheers, and sorry for bringing up No Man’s Sky again. Consider it an out of season April Fools joke.</p>

26:36 Mailbag: The New King of PC Gaming?  

Hello Diecast!
Activision Blizzard has fallen out of favor. Activision are encroaching ever more on Blizzard’s territory with demands on revenue, use of their platform(s), and new, more lucrative business strategies. Eurogamer cites a concern within Blizzard about Activision relationship. We can draw only one conclusion: the king of PC-gaming has fallen.
Who will take up the mantle? Who is the new king of PC-gaming?

<strong>00:00 Blizzard’s new game.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast:</p>
<p>Last year, Shamus wrote an article about stuff the industry should do, and one of the points listed was “hire a gamer.”<br>
<a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=39431">https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=39431</a></p>
<p>This year at Blizzcon, one of the major announcements was a new Diablo game! …for phones! The reaction was negative, to put it lightly.</p>
<p>I’m not going to be one of the “they shouldn’t have made this game” people, but I will say that didn’t anybody in a marketing position realize how this would go over? Did they just not KNOW that there’s a lot of overlap between “willing to go to Blizzcon” and “holds phone games in contempt”? I’m hoping this won’t turn out like Dungeon Keeper Mobile or Command &amp; Conquer Rivals, because Activision isn’t as bad as Electronic Arts, but they’re still pretty bad, and phone games have a reputation for being bad, cash grabby, and frequently both, to the point that it’s newsworthy when a mobile game that gets popular isn’t sucking ass and money at the same time.</p>
<p>In short, do you think if anybody in a position of power actually knew anything about the culture, would the announcement of this have been a quiet aside instead of a major deal?</p>
<p>– MechaCrash</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is the YongYea video talking about how Blizzard has mobile versions coming out for all of their IP:</p>

<p><strong>24:30 Witch Watch</strong></p>
<p>We’re going to be spoiling most of my book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Witch-Watch-Shamus-Young-ebook/dp/B007AKDFM8/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1541403103&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=witch+watch">which you can buy on Amazon</a>. Although now that we’ve spoiled it you’ll probably be less likely to do so. Whoopsie.</p>
<p><strong>45:12 Close Encounters of the Third Kind</strong></p>
<p>During this segment I said that the movie came out in 1979, but it was actually from 1977. I was six when it came out, and probably 10 or so when I saw the movie for the first time. In case you missed <a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=44755">yesterday’s post</a>, here’s the music I made as a result of watching the movie:</p>

      <itunes:summary>This week we bring you yet another show, now with 15 extra minutes of show. You get 25% more show for the same money. That’s a good value! On the other hand, the first 25 minutes are basically a spoiler for my column later in the week.


Hosts: Paul, Shamus. Episode edited by Issac.

Show notes:
00:00 Blizzard’s new game.

Dear Diecast:
Last year, Shamus wrote an article about stuff the industry should do, and one of the points listed was “hire a gamer.”
https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=39431
This year at Blizzcon, one of the major announcements was a new Diablo game! …for phones! The reaction was negative, to put it lightly.
I’m not going to be one of the “they shouldn’t have made this game” people, but I will say that didn’t anybody in a marketing position realize how this would go over? Did they just not KNOW that there’s a lot of overlap between “willing to go to Blizzcon” and “holds phone games in contempt”? I’m hoping this won’t turn out like Dungeon Keeper Mobile or Command &amp; Conquer Rivals, because Activision isn’t as bad as Electronic Arts, but they’re still pretty bad, and phone games have a reputation for being bad, cash grabby, and frequently both, to the point that it’s newsworthy when a mobile game that gets popular isn’t sucking ass and money at the same time.
In short, do you think if anybody in a position of power actually knew anything about the culture, would the announcement of this have been a quiet aside instead of a major deal?
– MechaCrash
Here is the YongYea video talking about how Blizzard has mobile versions coming out for all of their IP:




20:52 No Time for Programming

:(

24:30 Witch Watch

We’re going to be spoiling most of my book, which you can buy on Amazon. Although now that we’ve spoiled it you’ll probably be less likely to do so. Whoopsie.

45:12 Close Encounters of the Third Kind

During this segment I said that the movie came out in 1979, but it was actually from 1977. I was six when it came out, and probably 10 or so when I saw the movie for the first time. In case you missed yesterday’s post, here’s the music I made as a result of watching the movie:




53:09 California is on fire again?

Or perhaps California is still on fire? I’m not sure how it works.

59:04 Mailbag: Long-lasting games.

Hi there, Diecastians!
Recently, I had to explain in one sentence to a non-gaming person what is Heroes of Might and Magic 3, and I chose to focus on its longevity, since I have friends that still play it on a semi-regular basis. What are your favorite games that have (so far) stood the test of time? 
Thank you for your thoughts and lovely voices,
Galad_t

		<p>Here we spend half the show talking about Halloween, everyone’s favorite blend of stranger danger, cosplay, and diabetes! I know a lot of American culture leaks out into the rest of the world, but I don’t know if that includes Halloween. How widespread is the practice of dressing up in costume and begging around the neighborhood for candy?</p>

<p>Show notes:<span id="more-44573"></span></p>
<p><strong>01:43 Halloween vs. Christmas</strong></p>
<p>The observation we make here is that Halloween is growing in cultural significance while Christmas is shrinking. Like I said on the show, we’re deliberately avoiding the possible religious dimension to this. Having said that, maybe I’m off base here. Maybe it only seems like Christmas is diminishing. I only have my personal experience to go on. I’m curious if others have noticed a similar trend. </p>
<p>Like I said on the show, I can’t really eat candy because I can’t eat corn and ALL candy in the US is made with corn syrup. Except, a couple of weeks ago we found candy corn made with cane sugar instead of corn syrup. Yes, the one candy that contains no corn is candy corn. </p>
<p>Also, here are a couple of examples on my favorite gag costume:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wvQmfUD598">Wayne’s World One-man Halloween Cosplay – Best Costume Ever!</a><br>

<p><strong>30:06 Distance Level Editor is Groovy</strong></p>
<p>If you’re curious, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/shamusyoung/myworkshopfiles/?appid=233610">here are the levels I’ve uploaded</a>. Just be warned that I’m not really in sync with the rest of the community and I’m not making what the bulk of players are into. I favor long tracks that more more about the lights and music and less about crazy car stunts. </p>
<p><strong>32:42 Oxygen Not Included.</strong></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>39:27 Shadow of the Tomb Raider</strong></p>
<p>To be clear, I’m only a couple of hours in. Maybe it gets to be less boring at some point. We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>48:28 Patreon integrated Discord server</strong></p>
<p>Paul set up a Discord server for <a href="https://www.patreon.com/dudecon/overview">his Patreon</a>. I know I covered this on the show, but let me go over it again for you non-podcast folks:</p>
<p>I’m considering creating a Discord channel for Patreon backers.</p>
<p>On one hand, I want all my content available to everyone for free. Content that’s behind a paywall is content that, essentially, doesn’t exist. If Google can’t find it and if you can’t share it with your friends, then it’s like the content isn’t really on the internet. </p>
<p>On the OTHER hand, I’d like to give some sort of special content to thank people for supporting me. I’m grateful for my supporters and I’m always keen to show my appreciation beyond typing the word “Thanks!” once in a while.</p>
<p>These are two contradictory goals and I’ve never been able to figure out how to reconcile them. I want to reward supporters, but I don’t want that reward to feel like paywalled content. If someone isn’t supporting me financially, I don’t want them to feel like I’m trying to punish them. </p>
<p>From seeing what other creators are doing, it seems like previews are the way to go. Maybe streams, chat channels, and little updates for “here is how far I am into writing project X” or “here is the next game I plan to cover”. Discord seems like a good fit for this.</p>
<p>On the other hand… I dunno. Feel free to share your thoughts on any of this. If you support other creators or hang out in Discord groups, I’d love to hear your views on what works and what annoys you.</p>
<p>For the curious, during this segment I mention <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWQSPDWeLLw">Screen Rant Pitch meeting</a>, which is pretty fun and worth checking out.</p>

<strong>02:06 The Social Network.</strong> </p>
<p>Yes, I’m talking about an 8 year old movie. I’m sure you’ve been waiting all these years to hear my scattershot, non-committal take.</p>
<p>In the show I wondered what the man himself thought of the movie. As it turns out, other people have asked him the same question. Here is Mark Zuckerberg On The Social Network:</p>

<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>24:37 Mailbag: Windows 10 S</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hey guys.</p>
<p>I recently discovered the existence of Windows 10 S, which is apparently Microsoft’s response to the success of Chrome OS and Chromebooks.  Did you know about this?  It’s supposed to be faster, simpler, and more secure than regular Windows 10, but there are a few supposed features that make me think that it just might be Shamus’ nightmare come to life.  In order of increasing horribleness, they are:</p>
<p>(1) you can upgrade to Windows 10 proper . . . if you fork over an extra $50,</p>
<p>(2) Microsoft Edge is not only the default browser but the only available browser, because</p>
<p>(3) you can only install software that you bought from the Windows Store.</p>

<p>Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avwLrOBOxS4">the video</a> I was talking about that compares Denuvo with Microsoft’s UWP.</p>

<blockquote><p>How do you feel about badly-written endings in narrative-heavy games? Do they ruin the entire experience, or are they just one unpleasant hour and the rest of the game is still fine?</p>
<p>I feel like in theory, bad endings don’t have to ruin a game: for instance I think Life is Strange’s ending is really dumb but 60% of it is just slice of life character stuff that stands on its own, so the ending doesn’t cripple the whole game. Usually though, games feel structurally akin to a detective novel: most of the runtime has been building towards the ending in some way and if the conclusion to your locked-room murder mystery is “A wizard did it” then the whole thing was a waste of time.</p>

<p>I noticed (that’s no fault of yours or criticism, just an observation, I want to apologize in advance for any potential misunderstanding), that you mostly write about AAA games. Do you want to try and write about something obscure? Like an AA game (e.g. Pillars of Eternity or Elex), or really niche RPG (from Spiderweb, for example). Just to stretch your muscles, so to speak.

00:00 Issac’s Birthday

My youngest turned 17 last week. He’s spent less than half of those years playing Garry’s Mod.

03:38 Steam Updates

So what do we think of the idea that store pages on Steam will feature a livestream of the game in question (if available) and you have to scroll down to see the trailer and other info?

06:27 Cardlife




11:59 Flotilla 2 by Blendo Games

14:23 Nimbatus




Also, I’m interested to think what people think of the pricing for Early Access games. Sometimes the developer starts high when the game is unfinished and lowers it at release, and sometimes they do the opposite. Both have advantages and disadvantages that I find fascinating.

23:28 Digital comic books

Here’s an overview on the distribution problems comics have faced over the years:




37:12 Mailbag: Manhattan and other cities in games

Dear diecast,
Many game have included the island of Manhattan in New York as a game world due to it being iconic while at the same time easily isolated for a game world yet at the same time a metropolitan area is developed for residents not gameplay. If you were to be doing an open world based on New York how would you attempt to do it?
Yours JDMM
54:58 Mailbag: Microsoft and Minecraft

Dear Diecast
The comments on why Minecraft doesn’t need a version 2 made by Microsoft in this article seem to gel quite well with some of Shamus’s comments on how games companies should manage their properties. How do we feel about Microsoft these days?
Kind regards
Gordon

00:00 Moving Sucks  

The swivel arm for my microphone broke this week, which means I needed to have the microphone quite a bit further from my face than I usually do. You’ll probably be able to hear the difference. Over the last few weeks one of the most common phrases around the house has been “We’ll have to fix / replace that once we’re done moving.” This is yet another instance of something that isn’t going to get fixed until after we move.

17:20 Distance

Hi Shamus, and Paul,
Have you looked into Distance, the pretty neon laser puzzle racer again, it had a full release recently? Can you please write some articles about it, from the POV of a confused rally pilot that somehow got into that universe (eventually, I know you’ll be pretty busy for a while). I know you have the humor chops to make it highly entertaining!
Kind regards,

28:07 Corporate Leadership

Dear Diecast (Mostly Shamus but Paul can answer too)
In your last couple of “This Dumb Industry” and “Experienced Points” you have talked about how publishers being run by business people is one of the big problems with the industry.  What reasonable solutions do you have to fixing this problem other than putting Shamus in charge.
Regards Eric

Go to the map and click on the city you want to go to etc with no accounting of the passage of time and effort that requires from your character.

<p>But that’s all just jarring, where it becomes infuriating is when it encourages lazyness in the game devs. Skyrim is a good example of this. Stupid side missions like “kill the rats in my basement” will often times have said basement on the complete opposite side of the map from the mission giver. As if the devs knew the player had fast travel and so location doesn’t matter and so where that basement is on the map is irrelevant. Which may also explain why the map in Skyrim was bordering on unusable.</p>
<p>On the flip side of that in some games the travel itself is a joy and I’ve had great success in having a personal rule of no fast travel. Farcry 3/4 for example, time spent getting around in jeeps and hang gliders is some my favorite gameplay time.</p>
<p>There’s supposed to be a question after the mini rant…<br>
So what do you think of fast travel systems?<br>

35:30 Young People and Bad Business Practices

Hello blue da ba dee da ba Diecast!
Last week I turned 30, which made me realize something. (Other than not being 29 anymore.)
By gamer standards I’m pretty old.
In a hobby where one could be considered a “hardcore” participant at the age of 8, 10 or 16, 30 seems like
a rather experienced age.
This got me thinking about my absolute disdain towards monetization in todays games.
DLC, Season Passes, more homogenized designs and of course loot boxes.
I’ve heard a lot of gamers excusing and defending these practices as no big deal and accusing it’s detractors of being selfish, entitled and unreasonable. 
I wonder if the majority of these gamers are too young to have grown up with games where your customisation options weren’t locked behind random chance, the grindy parts weren’t tied to a games profits through ingame currency and very important-to-the-story characters weren’t sold as seperate (looking at you Javik from Mass Effect 3).   
Basically my question is,
Do you think a gamers age can be linked to their tolerance for shitty business practices, since that’s what they grew up with?
Thanks for reading, and keep up the great show!
48:21 Photorealism  

Dear Diecastians,
Recently I’ve been playing some Ubisoft games, to include Assassin’s Creed and Ghost Recon. I find the photorealistic environment detail in these games to be incredibly distracting!  
But it got me to wondering:  How are these environments created? Are they  somehow computer-generated via giant art asset libraries? Or do they run environmental artist sweatshops? 
I’m really hoping it’s the former and not the later. What are your thoughts on this and do you find it as distracting as I do?
Cheers,

The answer to both of these is that I haven’t played them, I am interested in them, but I don’t have time for either one.

Also, if you don’t get the Zombo.com reference, then THIS IS ZOMBO COM! The only limit is your imagination. (This was a lot funnier at the height of the dot-com boom.) 

54:20 Spider-Man

This is it. This is the game I’ve been waiting for since I was a child.

00:05 A Sad, awkward take about the number 224.

This story takes place at Seven Springs, but it isn’t nearly as cool or fun as my visit to Seven Springs the following year.

04:55 Spec Ops: The Line

You might remember that I just read a book that talked about the making of this game.

20:49 Dark Souls

I mentioned Joseph Anderson in this section. Here is an example of one of his videos:




And here is the recent 3-hour video on God of War I mentioned. While I can’t say for sure, I’m reasonably sure this the the We are the Souls video SoldierHawk was talking about. 

38:01 Grand Theft Auto V

Note that I’m going to spoil some of the points I’m going to make in my Grand Theft Auto series.

54:40 World of Warcraft

If you missed it, here is my write-up on the Cataclysm expansion.

<p><strong>01:03 Graphics card naming </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast</p>
<p>With Nvidia’s announcement of their new RTX 2000 cards and all their talk of Giga Rays it reminded me of a problem I used to have back when I worked in gaming retail.  </p>
<p>Due to the fact that most PC games had/have limited use one time codes we had a no returns policy on PC games which is obviously a problem for people who do not know if a particular game will run on their hardware.  Customers would often ask me if a particular game will run on their PC and I would try and answer to the best of my ability but sometimes it is not always easy to help.  Sometimes their hardware would be older or newer and I would have to try guesstimate how it compared to the listed requirements or they would ask why 2 graphics cards were so different in price or performance when they had the same amount of VRAM, etc.  </p>
<p><strong>My question at the end of all of this is could there be a better way to classify and quantify hardware performance so that people who are not experts can more easily figure out what they have and what they need?</strong></p>
<p>Regards Eric</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>10:51 Linux vs. Windows</strong>  </p>
<blockquote><p>Dear casters of die,</p>
<p>recently Steam released Proton, their custom Wine implementation allowing<br>
Linux users to run Windows games. Do you guys think this could cause a shift<br>
in the market?</p>
<p>As always, thanks for the great show!</p>
<p>-Tim</p></blockquote>
<p>Looking into this after the show, I can see why I didn’t hear about this sooner. Proton isn’t really ready for casual adoption yet. You can tell because you don’t get it from Valve. Instead, <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/">you get it from GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>On one hand, getting Windows games running on Linux is a HARD problem to solve. On the other hand, Valve has deep pockets and it <em>is</em> solvable. It’s too soon to tell right now, but it will be very interesting to see how this works out in the long term. Maybe this will be another SteamBox style failure, or maybe this will be another paradigm shift like Steam itself. Either way, it’s a good thing for PC Gamers. Anything that keeps Microsoft from getting too complacent is good for us.</p>

<p><strong>22:16 Bully</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear rollers of analogue pseudo random number generators,</p>
<p>I am back and I have an inquiry upon your opinions in regards to DLC. You might want to cut out the next bit for brevity.</p>
<p>The history of DLC since it inception is quite intriguing and turbulent. First there were cosmetic stuff and useless bits (Horse Armor). Followed by the wave of cut out content (Battle for Forli in AC2). Then there was the phase of some additional missions without anything really of interest in regards to gameplay and/or story. And lastly we had an increase of either mini expansions or experimental story/mission pieces. Things like the Fallout DLC comes to mind or the DLC packs for Mafia 3 and the newer Far Cry games (4 and beyond). The last thing i find especially interesting given that these are sometimes used to prototype mechanics and ideas for future games. Question: Do you think about this practice of using DLC as prototype testbed?</p>
<p>An addendum:<br>
<strong>You stated San Andreas is the best Rockstar game because it had heart. I personally think Bully is the best one for similar reasons even if most characters are asshats. Have you ever played Bully or would you consider trying it out?</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore I was wondering which kind of speedrun you prefer? The ones where one glitch is repeated over and over again and is abused ad absurdum or more of the technical kind where a lot of skills are being used?</p>
<p>Lastly:<br>
There is a lot of bashing going on in the direction of Ubisoft due to their open world games all being the same. Or at least sameish. I personally have the feeling that this open world sameyness already existed long before the Ubisoft formula was established. Sure Open World games are samey within their genre but if you compare entries from a specific developer you will always have quite a bit of sameness. Just Cause and Mad Max are somewhat self similar. But given your recent experiences with some Rockstar games would you say that they are similar to each other. I personally would extend them being similar to all Rockstar games be it GTA, Bully or Read Dead. Please discuss.</p>
<p>Cheers and a nice weekend from Austria,<br>
Gresman</p>
<p><strong>PS: Would you be willing to share the distribution of your readers over the globe if you have access to such data?</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I should add to what I said on the show: I loved Bully, but the classroom minigames were pretty bad. </p>
<p><strong>26:20 Distribution of readers</strong></p>
<p>Like I said on the show: We’re coming up on the anniversary of the site. I’ll do a post with a bunch of random factoids about the site. I suspect that post will happen next Tuesday, the 4th. If you have any questions about the readership of this site, the database that holds it, or the technology that holds it all together, now is the time to ask.</p>
<p><strong>26:59 Net Neutrality</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>To the last die caster.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on Net Neutrality now that it was officially repealed as law in the US?</p>
<p>I know that when you first wrote about it Net Neutrality was an unspoken rule no-one broke because it would ruin it for everyone, but since then companies started to break it and ruined it for everyone, which in turn forced the US government to sign it into law.</p>
<p>Now that companies are free to break it, and since they’ve clearly paid handsomely for this “benefit” they will, how would it affect American costumers? And how it would affect other countries that have their connection go through US cables, like South American costumers trying to access servers in Europe and the like?</p>
<p>signed,<br>
RCN, your Brazilian fan</p></blockquote>
<p>Whenever I caution people against talking politics, I always get a little pushback in the form of, “But Shamus, EVERYTHING is politics!” Note here that when I say “politics” I’m talking specifically about partisan politics of the classic Red vs. Blue variety. These arguments will always spiral into ugly tribalism. There will always be one or two people who feel the need to unleash their pent-up frustration and irritation on anyone from the Other Party. They mean well, but these arguments are a dead-end and I don’t care to watch my readers tear each other apart over things we can’t change.</p>
<p>To put it more specifically: I really enjoy abstract thought experiments talking about how you balance the desire for freedom against the need for regulation and the drawbacks of going too far in either direction. That’s an interesting discussion. For contrast, I don’t care what you think of Donald Trump or Ajit Pai and I don’t care to moderate the argument that will result if you decide to start an argument centered American partisan politics.</p>
<p>There are a lot of interesting topics this week. Please don’t make me close the comments because you can’t participate in this discussion without picking a fight.</p>
<p><strong>40:27 Modding</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Have you had any experience making mods? Of so, what’s the most/least fun you’ve had doing so? </p>
<p>Thanks, Echo Tango!</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/p-r/relive">Here is the Doom2 mod I made back in 1995</a>. That’s the last major mod I made. It’s also just before I got married. (The release date is actually just a couple of weeks after the wedding.) I imagine these two facts are at least somewhat related.</p>

Dear Diecast

<p>Show notes:<span id="more-43420"></span><br>
<strong>00:00 Experienced points will return to the Escapist</strong></p>
<p>I don’t have details yet, but I’m reasonably sure this is happening.</p>
<p><strong>05:37 What was your first game? </strong></p>
<p>Go ahead and answer this in the comments if you like: <em>What is the first game you remember playing?</em></p>
<p><strong>12:25 What was the first game you remember not liking? </strong></p>
<p><strong>27:02 What’s the oldest game you could still enjoy today? </strong></p>
<p>I notice there’s a pretty hard cutoff for me right around 1998 or so. Anything older than that is hard to play for any length of time. I wonder if this threshold will continue to move forward as I age, or if there was <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=40956">something special</a> about that point in history. (Reminder: I’m pretty PC-centric now, and was even moreso in the 90s.)</p>
<p><strong>32:16 A game that needs to be revived?</strong></p>
<p><strong>36:06 Mailbag: Anime</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast, </p>
<p>I’ve noticed that the site contains an anime category which has not been updated since early 2008. My question is, does Shamus or anyone else have plans to do reviews or retrospectives on one of the many anime series that have been released over the years? I would love to see a large, analytical take on some of the more controversial shows, like Sword Art Online.</p>
<p>-Allie</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>38:12 Mailbag: No Man’s Sky</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>So Paul,</p>
<p>Now that your favorite game, No Man’s Sky, has multiplayer, are you going to play it together with Shamus so that the two of you can finally see the brilliance of this brilliant game and eat all your negative comments you made about this brilliant peace of art?</p>
<p>Sincerely, a brilliant troll</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>On one hand, I really would like to try NMS multiplayer just so I can see what it’s like. On the other hand, I really don’t think Hello Games deserves another sale as a result of leaving GoG players in the lurch.</p>
<p>Also, given the pulpy, random, hand-wavy approach this game has to its science, claiming “every atom procedural” is strange and misleading. This game barely simulates things on a macro level, much less a subatomic one. I mean, the planets are fixed relative to one another and <em>the sun orbits around the planets</em> to create the day / night cycle. Claiming that every atom is procedural is like claiming that Minecraft simulates all the internal organs of the player character. <em>That’s not even something depicted in the game, much less procedural!</em></p>
<p>Ugh. This game drives me crazy.</p>
<p><strong>42:05 Mailbag: Switch</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Shamus,<br>
You and the rest of the diecast crew had an Nintendo Switch launch espectacular in which most of you seemed pretty down on the new console (except Campster and you daughter IIRC). Has your perspective on it changed since? Why do you think the machine is successful?</p></blockquote>

Show notes:
00:00 Experienced points will return to the Escapist

I don’t have details yet, but I’m reasonably sure this is happening.

05:37 What was your first game? 

Go ahead and answer this in the comments if you like: What is the first game you remember playing?

12:25 What was the first game you remember not liking? 

27:02 What’s the oldest game you could still enjoy today? 

I notice there’s a pretty hard cutoff for me right around 1998 or so. Anything older than that is hard to play for any length of time. I wonder if this threshold will continue to move forward as I age, or if there was something special about that point in history. (Reminder: I’m pretty PC-centric now, and was even moreso in the 90s.)

32:16 A game that needs to be revived?

36:06 Mailbag: Anime

Dear Diecast, 
I’ve noticed that the site contains an anime category which has not been updated since early 2008. My question is, does Shamus or anyone else have plans to do reviews or retrospectives on one of the many anime series that have been released over the years? I would love to see a large, analytical take on some of the more controversial shows, like Sword Art Online.
-Allie
38:12 Mailbag: No Man’s Sky

So Paul,
Now that your favorite game, No Man’s Sky, has multiplayer, are you going to play it together with Shamus so that the two of you can finally see the brilliance of this brilliant game and eat all your negative comments you made about this brilliant peace of art?
Sincerely, a brilliant troll



On one hand, I really would like to try NMS multiplayer just so I can see what it’s like. On the other hand, I really don’t think Hello Games deserves another sale as a result of leaving GoG players in the lurch.

Also, given the pulpy, random, hand-wavy approach this game has to its science, claiming “every atom procedural” is strange and misleading. This game barely simulates things on a macro level, much less a subatomic one. I mean, the planets are fixed relative to one another and the sun orbits around the planets to create the day / night cycle. Claiming that every atom is procedural is like claiming that Minecraft simulates all the internal organs of the player character. That’s not even something depicted in the game, much less procedural!

Ugh. This game drives me crazy.

42:05 Mailbag: Switch

Shamus,
You and the rest of the diecast crew had an Nintendo Switch launch espectacular in which most of you seemed pretty down on the new console (except Campster and you daughter IIRC). Has your perspective on it changed since? Why do you think the machine is successful?

Show notes: 

00:00 The Escapist Lives Again

I sort of already covered this yesterday, but this should be good if you were hoping for the more rambling, less concise version.

07:02 No Man’s Sky NEXT


My favorite part of the new update was when I found an alien named Dave.

On the show I said that the game wasn’t any better. That’s not entirely fair. The game is better in terms of the ratio between hassle and fun, but the changes don’t really get to the heart of the problem, which is that so much of the design is focused on highly repetitive tasks that put you under inventory pressure.

Imagine a game where you randomly fall out of the level and die every ten minutes or so, losing all your progress. Then imagine the patch makes it so you get more checkpoint saves. Yes, that’s a huge help, but it doesn’t really address the source of the problem. That’s what the No Man’s Sky NEXT update feels like.

19:34 Marco Polo

Anyone else out there use this? Like I said in the show, it’s completely supplanted texting in my family.

22:39 Titans

And speaking of generating traffic by making people angry…




I’m guessing they’re copying the look &amp; feel of the Marvel Netflix properties? If so, maybe the show will find an audience. I don’t care for that style of slow-burn serialized filler, but it’s really popular. 

34:24 Webhost Nightmares

Hi!
Promise it will be a short one. Unlike the last time.
I’ve started to watch this video, but I’ve got a question on my own.
It’s about voice -d/-less protagonists. When the usage of either of them is justifiable/preferable? For example – would voiced protagonist improve System Shock 1/2, and what will it look like? Would removal of the voice of JC Denton make Deus Ex much worse? Do you have examples on your own to ponder on that question?

story? I’m curious what you thought about the ending twist; I liked it

<p>For you non-Americans: Obviously you don’t observe American Independence Day, but do you have some other holiday where fireworks are a major part of the celebration?</p>
<p><strong>10:12 Google Drive, Photos, Backups, and Grief</strong></p>
<p>I talked to my wife after recording this show, and she had the same problem Paul and I did. So now I’m curious if anyone out there finds the Google Drive behavior to be intuitive.</p>
<p><strong>48:36  Mailbag: Raytracing</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hello Paul, Shamus, Isaac</p>
<p>At the GDC 2018 nVidea and Microsoft promoted the upcomming “new thing” in game technology: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)">Raytracing</a></p>
<p>They will update their <a href="https://devblogs.nvidia.com/introduction-nvidia-rtx-directx-ray-tracing/">APIs</a> and Unity, Epic and Dice promised support.</p>
<p>What is your take on that shiny, new and expensive technology? Will it improve anything, that isn’t already accomplished? Will you try messing with it (after Pixel City Redux is completed/abandoned)?</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>
<p>Lars

Show notes:
00:00 July 4th

For you non-Americans: Obviously you don’t observe American Independence Day, but do you have some other holiday where fireworks are a major part of the celebration?

10:12 Google Drive, Photos, Backups, and Grief

I talked to my wife after recording this show, and she had the same problem Paul and I did. So now I’m curious if anyone out there finds the Google Drive behavior to be intuitive.

48:36  Mailbag: Raytracing

Hello Paul, Shamus, Isaac
At the GDC 2018 nVidea and Microsoft promoted the upcomming “new thing” in game technology: Raytracing
They will update their APIs and Unity, Epic and Dice promised support.
What is your take on that shiny, new and expensive technology? Will it improve anything, that isn’t already accomplished? Will you try messing with it (after Pixel City Redux is completed/abandoned)?
Best Regards
Lars
 
Here is a demonstration of real-time raytracing in action:

<strong>00:00 Intro </strong></p>
<p>The email is in the header if you’d like to send us more questions.</p>
<p><strong>00:54 Hitmans, and changing your opinion on a game.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi!</p>
<p>That’s a non-question first, since I’ve just listened to episode 211 and since I’m late I have a feel, that a comment under it will be pointless. Sorry for this frivolousness on my part.</p>
<p>Anyway, about Thief vs Thief 2. I do prefer T2, but I saw enough people who preferred the first one, they saw T2 more boring, since it lacked diversity of levels and moods (less horror and tomb raiding). Actually, I thought just like you, and hated these levels. But I replayed a year later and… I loved these levels. They do work, they have their own mood, and sometimes it’s more fun to evade every obstacle by using acrobatics, instead of killing everyone. Thief 2 is still better, but Thief 1 isn’t that much worse. Deadly Shadow’s is enjoyable (I don’t think that game is worthless, even missions other than Shalebridge Cradle are pretty good and worth playing).</p>
<p><strong>I’m surprised with your comment about Hitman and Hitman 2. Hitman 2 is a vastly inferior game, flaws of which were inherited by Absolution.</strong> More linear levels (many of which without the targets, you must just pass them through), very easy to get your cover blown (you can’t even run, just slowly walk), very limited choices of dispatching the targets, and removing money system in favor of unlocks (in a game about contract killer!). Codename 47 wasn’t perfect game, very uneven I agree. But highs of C47 were way higher than highs of SA, and lows are relatively equal. Thankfully, IOI made Contracts and Blood Money. May be it’s just me, who views Silent Assassin on par with Absolution.</p>
<p>So… The question is (returning to that Thief question remark)… <strong>Were there games, that after replaying them, you drastically change your opinion on them, for better or worse?</strong></p>
<p>Best regards, DeadlyDark</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>15:16 Choosing Guns in Games</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,<br>
I also started playing Destiny 2 recently, and wanted to get your thoughts on the weapon design.<br>
As I see it, there are three variables that define the overall appeal of a weapon:<br>
Firstly, its raw stats, the things that are directly measured by the in game power level.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the utility/suitability of the weapon: things that make a weapon better or worse for a given environment or play-style; for example, a higher capacity, lower damage weapon when facing swarms, a shotgun instead of a sniper rifle when in narrow, twisting corridors, or a sight that highlights enemies when in dark areas.</p>
<p>Thirdly is the aesthetics of the weapon: how it looks and feels to use. (There are some definite winners &amp; losers in this category, in my, admittedly biased, opinion)</p>
<p>How much do you care about each aspect? Are you willing to put up with a gun that is statistically more powerful, and well suited to the environment, if it looks or feels bad? Are there weapons that were surpassed in stat power several levels ago, but you still use because it is far better suited to your needs?</p>
<p>I find this problem more notable then in other games (ie borderlands) because swapping weapons around eats ammo, which is most noticeable on the power (purple) weapons, which also happen to be, in my experience, the category which has the most specialized weapons, which need to be changed to fit the situation more often. They also have the lowest ammo stores.<br>
Between that and the relative lack of "safe" spaces to mess around with menus in, picking a well rounded loadout is key, as if something isn’t working, it’s not easy to swap it out.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Shas’Ui</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>22:55 Timeless Games</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hello Diecast,</p>
<p>I’ve been wondering, <strong>is there any game that you often come back to and it still plays as good and feels as great as when you played it the first time? </strong></p>
<p>For me it’s Half-Life 2, everything just fits together so well… Also what do you think the secret to that kind of game is? IS it a mix of genuinely great game design and nostalgia?</p>
<p>Keep up the good work!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Luke</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>29:24 Controller Complexity</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>How do you feel about 4 face buttons being a standard for all consoles. I’ve been playing a lot with my old xbox recently and noticed that the black and white buttons are neat for some extra functions. So, now electronics have advanced a lot, why wouldn’t they put on 2 more.</p>
<p>Imagine 4 shoulder buttons and 6 face buttons. Seeing how often games have multi-button presses or tap/hold or multifunctional buttons (search and swap weapon for example) it seems silly not to just give devs a few more facebuttons to work with.</p>
<p>Chris</p></blockquote>

So… The question is (returning to that Thief question remark)… Were there games, that after replaying them, you drastically change your opinion on them, for better or worse?

15:16 Choosing Guns in Games

Dear Diecast,
I also started playing Destiny 2 recently, and wanted to get your thoughts on the weapon design.
As I see it, there are three variables that define the overall appeal of a weapon:
Firstly, its raw stats, the things that are directly measured by the in game power level.
Secondly, there is the utility/suitability of the weapon: things that make a weapon better or worse for a given environment or play-style; for example, a higher capacity, lower damage weapon when facing swarms, a shotgun instead of a sniper rifle when in narrow, twisting corridors, or a sight that highlights enemies when in dark areas.
Thirdly is the aesthetics of the weapon: how it looks and feels to use. (There are some definite winners &amp; losers in this category, in my, admittedly biased, opinion)
How much do you care about each aspect? Are you willing to put up with a gun that is statistically more powerful, and well suited to the environment, if it looks or feels bad? Are there weapons that were surpassed in stat power several levels ago, but you still use because it is far better suited to your needs?
I find this problem more notable then in other games (ie borderlands) because swapping weapons around eats ammo, which is most noticeable on the power (purple) weapons, which also happen to be, in my experience, the category which has the most specialized weapons, which need to be changed to fit the situation more often. They also have the lowest ammo stores.
Between that and the relative lack of &quot;safe&quot; spaces to mess around with menus in, picking a well rounded loadout is key, as if something isn’t working, it’s not easy to swap it out.
Thanks,
Shas’Ui
22:55 Timeless Games

Hello Diecast,
I’ve been wondering, is there any game that you often come back to and it still plays as good and feels as great as when you played it the first time?

Show notes: 00:00 Intellivision

I talked about this last week. 

For the record, this is the original Atari joystick:


The ridges at the base of the stick were perfect for trapping a mixture of dust and sweat in the grooves where you could always see it, but never properly clean it. The single-button interface smothered game design. The case was made of rigid plastic and was designed to fit the hands of an adult male, even though the machine was marketed to kids. Gaming was off to a rough start.

And when I talk about “affordances”, I’m referring to this Extra Credits episode. The game Paul was talking about was Striker.

<p><strong>42:22 Mailbag: Thief vs. Thief 2</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast, </p>
<p>I’m currently playing through Thief 2 for the first time (I’m 20) it might just turn out to be one of my favorite games I’ve ever played. This came as a major shock to me because I played Thief: Gold about a year ago and borderline hated it. I think this is mostly down to level design. Thief Gold’s levels are gigantic, labyrinthine, an filled nonsensical copy pasted rooms. Not to mention a few them also seem to have and odd fixation on zombie killing as well. Thief 2 scales down the levels a bit, makes the maps more detailed, and makes each area memorable which leads to less aimless wondering. Also some levels seem to funnel players to the correct area somehow even thought there are several paths, but I’m not a level designer so I don’t know. My point is that while [they] are identical in many ways, the level design feels drastically different and it seems like people don’t talk about it very much. Perhaps its because people really just aren’t talking about thief all that much. I mean, I haven’t even used a guide for Thief 2, while I basically had to use one for every level on the first. Anyways, do you have a preference between the 2 games and have you noticed this difference? </p>
<p>P.S.<br>
There is this level in the first game where you have to pretend you are a Hammerite student and you have to solve this puzzle by finding and flipping a bunch of tiny switches very quickly and I just lost it. Like seriously, how did anyone figuire that out without the interenet??</p>

20:11 Mailbag: Games that “get good” late.

Hi, Diecast!
My question isn’t exactly really interesting, but, eh, it never really stopped me.
Let’s say you play a game that – for most of the time, e.g. 15 hours – is boring. But then it has this one moment/segment that’s trully awesome. It’s so good, it’s practically an art of its own. Life changing experience. How willing would you be to play such a game, knowing that in advance? Or even replay it?
For example: for me Fallout 4 was… well, a rather boring game, but its DLC, “Far Harbor” was amazing. Would you play Fallout 4 just to get to this DLC?

All the best, Tocopheryl
For context, I pronounced this name “Tocophery” because I had this message in a Google Doc, and my cursor was positioned right at the end. The trailing lowercase L blended in with the cursor.

That’s the only one I have an excuse for. All the other names were butchered due to incompetence.

42:22 Mailbag: Thief vs. Thief 2

Dear Diecast, 
I’m currently playing through Thief 2 for the first time (I’m 20) it might just turn out to be one of my favorite games I’ve ever played. This came as a major shock to me because I played Thief: Gold about a year ago and borderline hated it. I think this is mostly down to level design. Thief Gold’s levels are gigantic, labyrinthine, an filled nonsensical copy pasted rooms. Not to mention a few them also seem to have and odd fixation on zombie killing as well. Thief 2 scales down the levels a bit, makes the maps more detailed, and makes each area memorable which leads to less aimless wondering. Also some levels seem to funnel players to the correct area somehow even though…</itunes:summary>

00:00 Let’s talk about modding!

Spoiler: We don’t begin to scratch the surface of the topic here. We focus a lot on the PC modding scene and don’t talk much about ROM hacks and the like.

06:02 Game unplayable without mods?

I wish I’d thought of this answer during the show, but Garry’s Mod strikes me as being a game that exists as a platform for mods and would be more or less pointless without them.

11:00 Games that would be ruined by modding?
14:03 Games that would benefit from modding.

As promised, here is what the game looks like with a shaderpack installed:


I love it.

To install this:

Get the Feed the Beast legacy launcher. Once you have it installed and running, find a modpack that sounds fun. I’m currently playing Direwolf20 for Minecraft 1.12.2Not sure if I’m into Direwolf yet. I just started.. Launch the game, make sure it works.

Exit the game and you’ll go back to the FTB launcher. Press the button that says “Open Modpack Folder”. That will open up an Explorer windowYeah, all of these directions are for Windows PC. If you’re on another platform you’ll have to figure this out for yourself. Good luck! that shows all of your mods. (There will be a lot.) Get a version of Optifine that matches the version of the modpack you’re running. If you’re playing Direwolf20, that’s 1.12.2. Download the file (you should get a .jar file) and place it in the folder you opened up a minute ago.

Fire up the game again. If you’re very lucky, it will work. If not… I have no idea. Sorry. It either means you downloaded the wrong version of Optifine, OR Optifine is randomly incompatible with one of the other dozens of mods. 

Fire up the game again. Yes, it takes five minutes to launch. Yes, every time. Yes, that’s absurd and even allowing for the inefficiencies of Java that’s probably a good order of magnitude larger than it should be.

Dear Diecast,
my friends are fond of saying “the only good code is your code, and only if you’ve worked on that codebase continuously / from the beginning”. Do you agree with that sentiment?
And on a related note, is there one thing you just wish every programmer would do or stop doing, and if so, what is it?

<strong>01:27 Factorio vs. Minecraft</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>You were fishing for subjects in the last podcast. I’d be curious to hear some chatter comparing the progression and endgame of modded (industrial) Minecraft, Factorio and any similar games you’ve played.</p>
<p>It’s my personal impression that this is much more clearly thought through and balanced in Factorio, I think due to it being a more focused team, maybe you disagree.</p>
<p>This post might be relevant:<br>
<a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-187">https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-187</a></p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>G</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>16:01 Software Licenses</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Open source software licenses seem to be written for pure software, and the Creative Commons licenses are for pure non-software (music remixes, photos, etc). Since games are at the intersection of these two areas, what are your thoughts on how open-source games should deal with this?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>– No name given</p></blockquote>
<p>I realize we didn’t actually answer this question, but I think we sort of proved that we’re unqualified to answer the question. </p>
<p><strong>25:28 Max Payne</strong></p>
<p>As promised on the show, I read and answered this question…</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m interested to know if the hosts have played the Max Payne games, and if so, what they think of the series? The first two were well-received by critics and the public alike, although I believe the second sold well below what Remedy had hoped. This probably contributed to the decade-long gap between the release of the second game and the third, as well as the change of developer to Rockstar Studios.</p>
<p>Max Payne 3 is interesting in comparison to the preceding games, and for all the decisions Rockstar made about what to imitate and where to diverge, not only in terms of gameplay mechanics but also narrative, setting and tone. It’s also interesting to consider what effect the 10 year advance in industrial trends might have had for the project, from both a design and a commercial perspective. It was a divisive game (to put it mildly) and I’d be really interested to hear your thoughts about it, should you have any.</p>
<p>Asdasd</p></blockquote>
<p>…and then once the show was over I went back to Diecast #4 to see what I said about the game in 2013, and if it matches my thinking today. (I didn’t remember that podcast at all.) </p>
<p>So here are my thoughts on what I said in 2013:</p>
<p>In 2013 I predicted that I’d play through the game again someday. (Wrong. I haven’t touched it.) But I also predicted that I’d forget about what a dull slog the endgame was. (Correct. I’d forgotten that.) I said that I’d have preferred dark rainy New York, but I was okay with the change of venue. (This matches what I said here in 2018.) </p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>34:23 Newest Game</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Short and simple:</p>
<p>What’s the game with the most recent release date that you’ve played?<br>
(For Early Access, whatever’s the most recently available would probably count…)</p>
<p>CrushU</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>39:09 Indies</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Good evening,</p>
<p>To celebrate the first time I’ve listened to more than half of the podcast (podcast are totally not my thing, so it’s a compliment to the diecast that I’ve listened to it), I’ve got a question to Shamus:</p>
<p>Do you play indies or other  lesser-known games? And if yes, how do you hear about them and how do you chose which one will you play? And why don’t you write a little post about some of them?</p>

You were fishing for subjects in the last podcast. I’d be curious to hear some chatter comparing the progression and endgame of modded (industrial) Minecraft, Factorio and any similar games you’ve played.
It’s my personal impression that this is much more clearly thought through and balanced in Factorio, I think due to it being a more focused team, maybe you disagree.
This post might be relevant:

16:01 Software Licenses

Open source software licenses seem to be written for pure software, and the Creative Commons licenses are for pure non-software (music remixes, photos, etc). Since games are at the intersection of these two areas, what are your thoughts on how open-source games should deal with this?
Thanks!

I realize we didn’t actually answer this question, but I think we sort of proved that we’re unqualified to answer the question. 

25:28 Max Payne

As promised on the show, I read and answered this question…

I’m interested to know if the hosts have played the Max Payne games, and if so, what they think of the series? The first two were well-received by critics and the public alike, although I believe the second sold well below what Remedy had hoped. This probably contributed to the decade-long gap between the release of the second game and the third, as well as the change of developer to Rockstar Studios.
Max Payne 3 is interesting in comparison to the preceding games, and for all the decisions Rockstar made about what to imitate and where to diverge, not only in terms of gameplay mechanics but also narrative, setting and tone. It’s also interesting to consider what effect the 10 year advance in industrial trends might have had for the project, from both a design and a commercial perspective. It was a divisive game (to put it mildly) and I’d be really interested to hear your thoughts about it, should you have any.

…and then once the show was over I went back to Diecast #4 to see what I said about the game in 2013, and if it matches my thinking today. (I didn’t remember that podcast at all.) 

So here are my thoughts on what I said in 2013:

In 2013 I predicted that I’d play through the game again someday. (Wrong. I haven’t touched it.) But I also predicted that I’d forget about what a dull slog the endgame was. (Correct. I’d forgotten that.) I said that I’d have preferred dark rainy New York, but I was okay with the change of venue. (This matches what I said here in 2018.) 




34:23 Newest Game

Short and simple:
What’s the game with the most recent release date that you’ve played?
(For Early Access, whatever’s the most recently available would probably count…)

39:09 Indies

Good evening,
To celebrate the first time I’ve listened to more than half of the podcast (podcast are totally not my thing, so it’s a compliment to the diecast that I’ve listened to it), I’ve got a question to Shamus:
Do you play indies or other  lesser-known games? And if yes, how do you hear about them and how do you chose which one will you play? And why don’t you write a little post about some of them?
Have a nice week.

00:00 Paul’s Fabulous Recording Coffin




07:12 Playing Nier: Automata

I talked about the game on the Shamecast last week. Every time I try to describe this game, the plot, the premise, or the characters, someone will jump in with a “Well, ACTUALLY Shamus, you haven’t seen the real ending, see it’s not really about…”

Yeah yeah yeah. I get it. But look, I can’t discuss the parts of the game I haven’t seen. I was more than fair to Nier. I put up with the crashes to get to the first ending or whatever. I got partway through another playthrough. It’s not my fault this game is unstable. Our options are to talk about the parts of the game I’ve seen or to not talk about the game at all. The hurdle of “You can’t talk about a game until you get all the endings” creates an awful selection bias where the only people supposedly “qualified” to discuss the game are people that loved it and were able to run it properly. 




21:12 Survival games and the conceit of self-sufficiency

The old post I was referring to was Game Developers at the Beach, which has always been one of my favorites but never seems to get a lot of love in terms of being cited / referenced / linked / discussed. (Maybe it needs a rewrite.) Some people try to see the allegorical rivalry between Will Wright and Cliff Bleszinski as a conflict between a protagonist and a villain, or between a boring nerd and someone who knows how to have fun, but really it’s not supposed to be an attack on either personality. These conflicting goals simply exist, and always will exist, and I think we’ll understand our games better when we have a more complete picture of why those “other people” play them.

If you like the idea of Paul and I playing Left 4 Dead together, then you can watch it happen this coming Wednesday.

Dear Diecast
This week the community is doing a Return to Bloodborne event, which just means encouraging people to create a new character and go through the game again while using all of the online features. A similar event was done yearly for Demon’s Souls, which had its servers shut down earlier this year. 
Which older game that you like would you participate in such an event for?
Love, Christopher 
03:21 Kerbal Space Program

The new DLC (which we shamefully didn’t name in the show) is called “Making History”. The stellar Scott Manley can give you a pretty good overview of what the new features are:




08:00 Issac played Deus Ex: Human Revolution

My son: This doesn’t work for me.

Me: That’s my boy!

13:57 SubNautica

Here is the first episode of the Let’s Play that Paul was talking about:




23:34 My site went down for 6 hours on Friday the 9th.

Note that I think I used the wrong terms here. The tiers of web service are roughly: 1) Shared Hosting. 2) VPS 3) Dedicated hosting. In the show I mispoke when I said I needed “shared hosting”. I need the second one.

I have better things to do than move my site again, after the last move was such a nightmare. And I’m paid up for the year and I’d hate to see that cash go to waste. But this host is ticking time bomb. 

Like I said on the show: I’m looking for a LAMPThe four pillars of the modern web: Linux, Apache, MySql, PHP. VPS with shell access. I know I got some recommendations the last time the site went down, but it’s been a few months and I’m looking for updated information. I have to crowdsource this, since, like I said in the show, the typical review sites don’t dig deep enough to find the big problems.

36:50 Affinity / Photoshop replacement

I can’t believe I’ve found a possible replacement for the venerable Paint Shop Pro 8.

<p>Like I said in the show, we were trying to think of works that had a fantastic opening but led to terrible sequels.

So I don’t think something like Highlander counts. Lots of long-running franchises degrade in quality over time, but we’re specifically looking for works that begin a story and fail to end it properly. Obviously there’s a lot of wiggle-room here, so see what you can come up with.</p>

<p><strong>4:08 Mailbag – Why So Nitpicky?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi!</p>
<p>First of all, I apologize in advance for any mistakes that I’ve made. English is not my native language (polish is). This whole e-mail is probably gibberish (especially since it’s the first mail in foreign language for me), but I’ll try to ask a question anyway. </p>
<p>Second: big fan of your work. I just wanted to say that.</p>
<p>Anyway, my question to Shamus, Paul and Bob is:<br>
I’ve recently watched MrBtongue episode called “TUN: The Shandification of Fallout”. In one section, you criticized the way Fallout 3 handled the logic of it’s own world, comparing it to much more well-thought worldbuilding of Fallout: New Vegas (what do they eat? e.g. Megaton vs Goodspring). I’ve also read Shamus retrospection of the Mass Effect series (THE WHOLE THING). It’s makes me wonder, to what extent the games like that should justify the events they’re presenting – since if we were going to logically deconstruct everything in fictional world, eventually nothing would remain. So my question (finally) is: in which point the game should stop explaining it’s own world? To what degree the fictional world of that kind of games should be logically construct? Is there a clean line to be drawn? And how much of a game’s world should be just made-up? </p>
<p>(I’m not gonna lie, your language is pretty funny; hope the question is not too long, I couldn’t help myself – I mean, the Bob himself is here!)</p>
<p>Cheers to the whole crew of Diecast and hope you’re going to have a great time!<br>
Sincerely,</p>
<p>Darek (hmm… “Darius” I guess?)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>14:36 Mailbag – How Would You Have Written It?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Hey Shamus,</p>
<p>I have a (multi-part) question I’d like to ask both Bob and you. There’s a minor hitch, though.</p>
<p>It’s about Mass Effect.</p>
<p>No, wait! Let me explain!</p>
<p>I want to make something absolutely clear before I proceed: if you don’t want to hear about the subject any more, or put it on the podcast, I totally understand. Both you and Bob have covered the series in the past many many times over in various formats, and I don’t blame you if you just stop reading right here, right now. If that’s the case, I guess all that’s left is for me to thank you both from the bottom of my heart for all the time and effort you’ve put into discussing and deconstructing the ME games. Your analyses are amazing and I think it wouldn’t be an exaggeration if I said that they have helped me immensely to grow not only as a fan of the series, but as a consumer of pop culture in general. You guys are the best, and I love you both forever. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3

Now, on the off chance that enough time has passed for you not to be completely sick of hearing about Mass Effect, here is my question (for the sake of convenience I'm leaving it in its original format, which was conceived before I wrote this prolonged introductory bit, so there are some redundancies -- sorry about that):

"It's probably fair to say that you have spent a significant amount of time deconstructing the Mass Effect series, especially following the ending of the game that I personally choose to believe was never made. In the process you have acquired a great understanding of the series, which you have shared with your audience on multiple occasions. But did you ever create, or toyed with the idea of creating, an alternate Mass Effect canon for yourself, based on your analysis of the games, your personal preference, and how you believe the story should have went?

If so, what would your "break-off point" be? What is the moment where you substitute your own story for the one proposed by the writer? Is it the infamous ending, the opening of the third game when the whole series went full anthropocentric, or even earlier, like when Shepard got blown out of the Normandy and died, only to be immediately resurrected (following atmospheric re-entry)? Do you include Andromeda at all (I'm completely ignoring it as I haven't played it, but for you it can be different)?

Basically, tell us about your Mass Effect headcanon, if you have any :) ."

Thanks for taking the time to read this. Take good care of yourselves and greetings from Poland (where it's currently freezing -- hope the winter isn't too hard on you stateside).

Love you guys,
Pawe?</p></blockquote>
<p>Correction: In this section I say that you work for Lester in Grand Theft Auto Online, and don’t meet the other characters. I just noticed on the Wiki that this isn’t the case. There’s quite a bit more to the game if you stick with it.</p>
<p><strong>31:25 Mailbag – Forbidden Adaptations.</strong></p>

4:08 Mailbag – Why So Nitpicky?

Hi!
First of all, I apologize in advance for any mistakes that I’ve made. English is not my native language (polish is). This whole e-mail is probably gibberish (especially since it’s the first mail in foreign language for me), but I’ll try to ask a question anyway. 
Second: big fan of your work. I just wanted to say that.
Anyway, my question to Shamus, Paul and Bob is:
I’ve recently watched MrBtongue episode called “TUN: The Shandification of Fallout”. In one section, you criticized the way Fallout 3 handled the logic of it’s own world, comparing it to much more well-thought worldbuilding of Fallout: New Vegas (what do they eat? e.g. Megaton vs Goodspring). I’ve also read Shamus retrospection of the Mass Effect series (THE WHOLE THING). It’s makes me wonder, to what extent the games like that should justify the events they’re presenting – since if we were going to logically deconstruct everything in fictional world, eventually nothing would remain.

Is there a clean line to be drawn? And how much of a game’s world should be just made-up? 
(I’m not gonna lie, your language is pretty funny; hope the question is not too long, I couldn’t help myself – I mean, the Bob himself is here!)

Show notes:
00:35 The System Shock Kickstarter debacle.

Here is the failure announcement from the team. Like I said in the show, I’ll be covering this in more detail tomorrow. 

In our talk, I claimed “we never saw any gameplay”. Technically, they do show you hitting zombies with a wrench. They showed that in the original Kickstarter video in 2016, and we saw they finally got back to that point just before the project was canceled. So it would be more correct to say they didn’t make any progress on gameplay, or that we didn’t see any new gameplay. 

Also a lot of what I said was conjecture.

21:18  Creeper World

Here is Creeper World 3 on Steam.

30:49  Having fun while playing Factorio with cheats.


This is the goal of the game. Just launch this rocket. It’s super easy!

For the record, I play with a mix of cheats and mods. I use the long reach mod to avoid having to walk into a nest of conveyor belts and grabber arms to reach the machine I want to interact with. 

I really wish there was a mod that let you beautify your base. Trees, signage, that sort of thing. Usually by the time I’m done the thing is a square mile of pavement and electrical wires and it looks sort of depressing.

42:37 Hey You! Bob Case is going to be on the next Diecast. Send us some questions for him. 

(Email in the header image.)

45:17 What happened to Project Frontier and Project Octree?

Here are the Unity tutorials I talked about. It’s probably the best overview of the process of starting with basic numbers and building up your own scenery. A shame they’re in video form.

I wish I had time for this sort of thing.

<p>The podcast-specific RSS feed is broken and isn’t going to be fixed anytime soon. I’ve tried a number of plugins for making podcast stuff, and most of them overbearing, overcomplicated things that assume your blog only exists to host a podcast. Also, I always get complaints that the RSS feed doesn’t work in iTunes or whatever, which is <em>the only thing I want the plugin to do</em>.</p>
<p>People are always telling me how easy and turnkey it is and how service X or plugin Y fixed everything, and it always ends up eating a bunch of time, causing confusion, and failing to work as advertised. I don’t know what sort of hassle you’re supposed to go through to get podcasting RSS to work, but it’s evidently more hassle than I’m willing to put up with. </p>

Sorry this one is late. We had to record on Sunday due to the intrusion of Real Life. 

Show notes: 

0:00:46: Project Scorpio Specs Announced

Ars Technica has the numbers. Many of them are very large numbers!

0:24:54: Unravel

Here is the E3 demo we talked about on the show:




0:33:18: Sims Settlements Fallout 4 Mod

Here’s the town I built:


Everyone lives at one building and works at another.

Actually, that’s not true. That’s the town my settlers built for themselves. I just dictated the layout.

0:42:18: Remakes, Remasters, and re-releases.

Here’s the Bulletstorm comparison I talked about:


Old Hotness
New &amp; Busted

<p>Funny story about this episode: I noticed Baychel sounded off, but for some unfathomable reason I didn’t say anything until <strong>after</strong> we’d recorded the show. Once I did, she discovered her good mic had come unplugged and the system had defaulted to using her crappy webcam mic. Sad trombone.</p>

0:13:36: Mailbag: Story vs. Gameplay

Dear Diecast
If you were about to play a standard 15-20 hour triple A game, would you rather it had an amazing story… but dreadful gameplay, or amazing gameplay and a terrible story? 
Sarah. 
0:27:28: Mailbag: Spider-Man Homecoming

What’s up Dear Diecast 
Are you looking forward to the new Spider-Man movie? Apart from some personal “It’s different and therefore it’s RUINED” complaints, I’m pretty hyped to see a Spider-Man movie in Marvel Studios’ hands. 
Your friendly neighborhood Christopher

<p>Baychel played the game for the first time this week. Here’s what she thought. You can read more of her thoughts on <a href="https://bayberrystudio.wordpress.com/2017/03/06/overwatch-and-rewards/">her blog</a>.</p>
<p><strong>00:12:10: Horizon: Zero Dawn</strong></p>

<p><strong>00:32:59: Borderlands 2</strong></p>
<p>I’m back into the game, and playing multiplayer with the family. This game follows a very similar cycle to Diablo II. Obsession leads to burnout. Burnout leads to dormancy. A few years of dormancy results in renewed interest. Renewed interest leads back to obsession.</p>
<p>To add to this, I think Borderlands 2 has my favorite game trailer of all time:</p>

<p>And because I know you’ll ask: Yes, I saw the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cw2gXq83n8">Gearbox talk on rendering tech that featured likely assets for Borderlands 3</a>. I might do a post on this at some point.</p>

<p>I think I need to stop getting excited when people say a game is “like Silent Hill”, because that phrase apparently means something different to me than to everyone else.

How come everyone in first person games are so short? I started playing Soma the other day, and Simon is only approximately a head taller than his own toilet cistern. I remember being shorter than a lot of handrails in Bioshock, too. What’s going on?
Love, Christopher(6’1″)
0:45:55: History lesson

I forget what game this relates to.

0:48:29: Lovecraft

Dear Diecast
When Lovecraft’s monsters are involved, people are often sticklers about following the rules or philosophy of his stories. Why do people care about how uncaring eldritch monstrosities are? There isn’t a lot of complaining when greek monsters are used outside of tragedies or trolls aren’t defeated by porridge eating contests. 
Lovecraft, Christopher

<strong>0:02:03: Favorite Jokes</strong></p>
<p>We talked about our favorite jokes. Here is mine:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>I laughed at this joke when I saw it in ~1996. I laughed at it every time I saw it afterwards. I laughed every time my brother quoted it at me in the early 2000’s. I laughed at it when I tried to repeat the joke on the show. I laughed at it when I looked up the video just now. </p>
<p>I dunno. It’s like this is the Everlasting Gobstopper of jokes. It never runs out for me.</p>
<p><strong>0:05:37: Man Walks Into a Bar</strong></p>
<p>A horse walks into a bar. The bartender looks at him and says, “Why the long face?”</p>
<p>This segment isn’t so much about the “Man walks into a bar” style of joke as it is about how we visualize jokes in our head. </p>
<p>I’ve mentioned Martin’s Bar before. If you’re trying to keep the continuity of your whole Shamus backstory straight, it was mentioned in <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=13314">this grim chapter</a> of my childhood. The building is still standing today, but it’s empty now. You can see it <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/411+E+Locust+St,+Butler,+PA+16001/@40.862801,-79.8911607,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x883362ee8c57afb3:0x1f96429f101796ab!8m2!3d40.862797!4d-79.888972">here</a>. (It’s the red brick building facing the corner.)</p>
<p>I suppose this means the Battlezone machine is gone.</p>
<p><strong>0:20:23: ASMR Videos</strong></p>
<p>As it’s been described to me, ASMR videos are designed to trigger that feeling of tingling excitement you get when you’re extremely happy. The sensation where you get goosebumps due to your overwhelming emotional state, and you feel simultaneously excited and yet serene. The last time I remember having that sensation was 1982. I was sitting on the couch by myself. The family had just set up the Christmas decorations and I was sitting in the darkened living room, staring at the constellations of colorful lights. Soft Christmas music was playing. I remember having this meta-thought about how soon this perfect moment would end, so I tried to memorize as much as I could. (And yet, I can’t remember what music was playing.)</p>
<p>I’ll probably never feel like that again. But maybe I should watch the Happy Gilmore clip a few more times to see if that does the trick.</p>
<p><strong>0:22:31: XCom 2</strong></p>
<p>My favorite part of the Xcom story is the part where I remembered that Bradley existed. Or was it Bradford? </p>
<p>Ah well. Whoever.</p>
<p><strong>0:37:42: FINAL Fantasy</strong></p>
<p>Josh has been playing the very last fantasy game. </p>
<p><strong>0:55:22: Dishonored 2</strong></p>
<p>Chris has just finished Dishonored 2.</p>
<p><strong>1:12:02: GTA V</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been playing GTA V for some reason. I have a love-hate relationship with this game. Parts of it are extraordinary. Parts of it sicken me. Other parts are just pathetic and irritating. </p>

<p>I couldn’t be on the show, since my family Christmas party was on the night we usually record. We’re not going to have a podcast for the next couple of weeks, since nobody wants to record a show on the eve / day of a major holiday.</p>
<p><span id="more-36092"></span><br>
<strong>0:01:00 Meandering conversation</strong></p>
<p><strong>0:06:00 Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</strong></p>
<p>Here the cast discusses the news Star Wars movie. Not to worry, there’s no spoilers because they get distracted and talk about popcorn for twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>0:25:00 Super Mario Runner</strong></p>
<p>Also the cast talks about barcades, <a href="http://www.daveandbusters.com/">Dave &amp; Busters</a>, and the state of modern arcade experiences.</p>
<p><strong>0:43:00 Josh played <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/440630/">The Brookhaven Experiment</a></strong></p>

I couldn’t be on the show, since my family Christmas party was on the night we usually record. We’re not going to have a podcast for the next couple of weeks, since nobody wants to record a show on the eve / day of a major holiday.


0:01:00 Meandering conversation

0:06:00 Rogue One: A Star Wars Story

Here the cast discusses the news Star Wars movie. Not to worry, there’s no spoilers because they get distracted and talk about popcorn for twenty minutes.

0:25:00 Super Mario Runner

Also the cast talks about barcades, Dave &amp; Busters, and the state of modern arcade experiences.

0:43:00 Josh played The Brookhaven Experiment

Mostly this is just a talk about VR. 

1:03:00 Rutskarn has been playing bad Mount &amp; Blade Mods

I suspect no one is really surprised by this announcement. Naughty Dog has been hinting they might continue the Last of Us story for years, and given it’s a probably even <i>more</i> beloved franchise than Uncharted, it seemed only a matter of time before a sequel was properly announced.</p>
<p><strong>0:29:45: Kojima’s Happy Ending is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2Hy96sOnq8">Death Stranding</a></strong><br>

<p>Like I said on the show: I’m going to be travelling during the second week in December. I’m not sure how well I’ll be able to keep up with comments, or if I’ll be able to queue up enough content to get us through. </p>
<p>Also, things may be disrupted a bit <em>this</em> week because I’m moving my home office.</p>
<p>My daughter Rachel moved out in early 2016. We left her room empty for a while, just in case she boomerang’d. But it’s been over half a year and she’s living stable, so I think she’s out for good. So we moved my son Issac into her room, and I’m taking Issac’s old room. This is a pretty big step for me. For two years I’ve been running this site from my living room where I’m constantly distracted by the television, guests, stuff going on in the kitchen, people playing music, people chattering on the phone, and a dozen other living-room things. But now I’m going to have my own room with a door.</p>
<p>That’s all good for the long-term, but in the short term it means tearing apart this gigantic command center of equipment and re-assembling it in another room. I know that’s bound to disrupt things around here, so please be patient if I’m worse than usual at moderating comments and answering emails.</p>

<strong>0:00:33: Tablet Computer Q&amp;A</strong><br>
I’m looking for a machine that can let me create content and admin this site. At the same time, we really don’t have a lot of money right now, since we’re spending it on the trip. </p>
<p>On the show I said we were looking at a Surface 2 Pro. I was wrong. The model my wife suggested is the Microsoft Surface, which is currently under $150 and comes with a keyboard. (Compare to Surface 2, which is around double that without the keyboard.) The other wrinkle is that after the trip, I won’t really have use for either device. But if we get the Surface, my wife could use it for digital art. So Chromebook is cheaper but useless once the trip is over, while Surface is more expensive but potentially will continue to be useful after the trip. The best way I can think of to make this decision is to gather as much information as possible before choosing.</p>
<p>So, anyone have any general advice for these devices? Things to watch out for? Have you used a Surface, or a Chromebook? Sure, I can read random reviews, but I find our discussions here to be a lot more useful.</p>

<p>I talked (snarked) about this on Twitter, and the response I got from a lot of people was “What about Child of Light and Valiant Hearts!?” as if I was being unfair. </p>
<p>Sure, once every few years Ubi puts out something experimental and different. But the vast bulk of their resources go into making a bunch of games that feel very similar and feel like design by focus group rather than having any sort of creative spark. It’s not that they never do anything interesting, it’s that claiming to have a “culture of innovation” is like saying that Batman has a “mirthful personality” because he’s gotten nailed by the Joker’s laughing gas a couple of times.</p>

<p>Having never played a Pokemon game, it’s amazing to me just how impenetrable this stuff gets. I think this is a good thing.

<p>It's been said before that video RPGs tend to use fantasy settings and themes. I'd like to discus how fantasy RPGs tend to specifically be epic fantasy.</p>
<p>There doesn't tend to be video RPGs based on sword and sorcery like from Robert E.

Though when Obsidian went independent with Pillars of Eternity they also made it epic fantasy.</p>

<p><strong>0:20:01 The creative direction of BioWare</strong></p>

<p><strong>0:42:05 Skyrim Remastered</strong></p>
<p>Okay, they took the original HD Pack textures and just literally scaled them up. So a 1024×1024 texture becomes 2048×2048. But that’s like enlarging a photograph. Making something bigger doesn’t ADD detail. Modern graphics cards already smooth rough pixel edges, so NOTHING is gained by doing this. They literally made the textures take up 4x as much memory for NO visual improvement. </p>
<p>They did add “god rays”, which is the effect where sun shafts will shine through tree branches, which is kind of cool if you happen to be in just the right spot and looking in the right direction at the right time of day in the right weather to see it. </p>
<p>They added new “water shaders” so now the rivers look like flowing streams of baby oil instead of water. But then to keep the download size down, they super-compressed the audio, which means the audio is lower quality than in the original. </p>
<p>What you end up with is a game that has worse audio, looks basically exactly the same, and costs $40. Oh, <em>Bethesda</em>.</p>

45:20 Mailbag: THE DEVIL in videogames.

Dear Devilcast,
In popular entertainment culture, which is your favorite appearance and presentation of the archetypal Devil, and why is it in Reigns, the awesome Tinder-like RPG king simulation?
Much Love,
Galad_t  \m/
Here is the game I mentioned: Lucius.

Here is Professor Rutskarn’s Introduction to Elder Scrolls Cosmology 101: Aedra and Daedra

54:25 Mailbag: Favorite Superhero movie.

Dear Diecast
What’s your favorite superhero movie? Live-action, cartoon, old, recent, anything goes.
Love, Christopher

<strong>0:01:07: Star Trek: The Next Generation: The Commentary Track</strong></p>
<p>Note that I WAY overestimated how much audio / video content we’ve produced. Spoiler Warning channel has 780 videos with an average length of about half an hour, for a total of 390 hours of video. Then there’s about 200 hours of Diecast, assuming an average length of 1.2 hours each. That’s a lot, but where nowhere near the 1,000 hours I guessed during the show. </p>
<p>To reiterate what I said on the show: I’m spread too thin to do more projects. What I really <em>want</em> to do is make more Reset Button videos, but producing one video takes something like 20 hours, and I know I don’t have that many spare hours. </p>
<p>Josh is pitching an idea that might only take me 2 hours to produce. We’d watch an episode of Trek, make a commentary track, and then you could download it and play it along with the show. Josh’s idea has the advantage that it would take me 2 hours to produce 1 hour of content. This is opposed to an article, which might take 6 hours to produce 5 minutes of reading or a Reset Button video, where it would take 20 hours to make 10 minutes worth of content. </p>
<p>Does Trek commentary sound like something you’d enjoy? Something that might be worth sharing? Something that might be worth another trip to the site every day? I’d love you hear your thoughts.</p>

Is there a game that “broke you” as a fan, so to speak. Turning you from young optimistic fans into the cynics we know and love.

My curiosity is simply how the (regular) five of you all met up and decided to do all these podcasts and let’s plays and the such.

<p>Trivia: I’ve been to one haunted house in my life. As it turns out, a lot of hay was used to decorate the place. I am brutally allergic to hay, to the point where it has put me into the hospital with an asthma attack on more than one occasion. I am far more scared of the real threat of asphyxiation than the feigned threat of the guy with a fake chainsaw and a sack on his head. </p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast</p>
<p>What’s your take on Mass Effect Andromeda having an established father and brother/sister for your character? Do you prefer when they provide some backstory and family for your character(like Dragon Age Dwarf Slum Origin or Dragon Age 2 for instance), or do you like it more when that’s as minimal as possible(like Mass Effect)? Odds on either of them dying/turning evil?</p>

Trivia: I’ve been to one haunted house in my life. As it turns out, a lot of hay was used to decorate the place. I am brutally allergic to hay, to the point where it has put me into the hospital with an asthma attack on more than one occasion. I am far more scared of the real threat of asphyxiation than the feigned threat of the guy with a fake chainsaw and a sack on his head.

Dear Diecast
What’s your take on Mass Effect Andromeda having an established father and brother/sister for your character? Do you prefer when they provide some backstory and family for your character(like Dragon Age Dwarf Slum Origin or Dragon Age 2 for instance), or do you like it more when that’s as minimal as possible(like Mass Effect)? Odds on either of them dying/turning evil?
Love, Christopher

Dear Diecast
How come not a single one of the 24 spoiler warning games has been Japanese? I’m never gonna get a Deadly Premonition, Dragon’s Dogma or Metal Gear Rising Revengeance playthrough at this rate! Do I have to get Superbunnyhop on again to make this happen?

<p>I think that’s probably the most colons I’ve ever had on one line. Anyway, Josh played through the previous game before diving in to Mankind Divided, and has some thoughts on returning to the game after so many years have passed.</p>

Here is an extra-long Diecast to distract you from the fact that these posts are still wonky and I need to fix that. 

Hosts: Josh, Rutskarn, Shamus, Campster,  Mumbles. 

Episode edited by Rachel.

Show notes:0:00:45: Mumbles gives her take on No Man’s Sky

Most of us talked about the game a couple of weeks ago, but now we get to hear what Mumbles thinks of it.

0:05:07: Zen Games

0:08:15: Mankind Divided




0:47:00: Looking Back: Josh discusses Deus Ex: Human Revolution: Director’s Cut

I think that’s probably the most colons I’ve ever had on one line. Anyway, Josh played through the previous game before diving in to Mankind Divided, and has some thoughts on returning to the game after so many years have passed.

For those that missed it here’s our coverage of the original cut of the game on Spoiler Warning:


This was the season where Campster joined the show. Time flies.

0:55:35: Harry Potter and the Cursed Child

THERE WILL BE TOTAL SPOILERS FOR ALL THINGS HARRY POTTER.

<strong>0:00:40: Looking ahead to the end of 2016.</strong></p>
<p>Looking back, it feels sort of like the <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=29624">Black Friday problem</a> I’ve talked about in the past. You want to release your games close to Christmas so that it’s there for gift-buyers. But then someone else does the same thing and you end up sharing the sales instead of dominating them. So you move the release date up a little bit to hit the shelves before them. But they get the same idea, and pretty soon everyone is fighting for October sales.</p>

<p><strong>0:05:55: Battlefield VS. Titanfall</strong></p>
<p><strong>0:11:19: Gears of War 4</strong></p>
<p>During the show I said I didn’t care about Gears of War. I’ve actually been curious about the series for a long time and now that it’s coming to PC I might actually check it out. Although, not at launch-day prices.</p>
<p><strong>0:14:42: Civilization 6</strong></p>
<p>I’m really looking forward to picking this up so I can be bad at it and play it wrong.</p>

<p><strong>0:23:54: Final Fantasy 15</strong></p>
<p><strong>0:27:05: Star Trek Bridge Crew</strong></p>
<p>I keep getting this confused with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Bridge_Commander">Star Trek Bridge Commander</a>, which is a totally different game.</p>
<p><strong>0:30:30: Pokemon Go</strong></p>

<p><strong>0:46:50: Quadralateral Cowboy</strong></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>0:56:20: Human Revolution</strong></p>
<p>I am NOT looking forward to this game. I found the whole <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-08-03-deus-ex-augs-lives-matter-slogan-an-unfortunate-coincidence">AUGS LIVES MATTER controversy</a> to be really off-putting<span class="snote" title="1">AND ALSO GRAMMATICALLY INCORRECT. It should be “AUG LIVES MATTER”.</span>. Not because the topic is too taboo (or whatever) to appear in a videogame, but because it was so clumsy, on-the-nose, and heavy-handed about it. Sure, you COULD use this topic as a <em>great</em> starting point for a story, but I have zero faith that it will be handled with the thoughtful nuance it deserves. I fully expect to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launched out of the game by on-the-nose, immersion-breaking references to Current Events.
</li><li>Irritated if the game casts my viewpoint as the Bad Guys.
</li><li>Embarrassed if they cast my side as the Good Guys.
</li><li>Frustrated if they use a topic as decoration but refuse to actually define it or integrate it with the world. (Like synths in Fallout 4.)
</li></ol>
<p>So I’m actually pretty ambivalent about this game so far. This is on top of the other problems we discussed in this episode, that this series has lost its way.</p>
<p><a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=31891">I SHOULDN’T NEED TO SAY THIS BUT I WILL</a>: This is not the place to talk about Black Lives Matter. We can talk about hijacking existing controversy as a marketing ploy, or using current events as setting flavor, but let’s leave the particulars of BLM out of it. If you see someone go too far, please for my sake let it slide and let me handle it. I’ll do my best to keep this stress-free for all of us.</p>

<p>Like I said in the show intro, I’m working on adding the podcast to Google Play and (eventually) to iTunes. While this is going on, the post will be a little wonky. (For example, as of right now there are two media players on this page, although if you’re reading this from the archives in the future then I’ve hopefully fixed it by now.) Please bear with us. <a href="https://play.google.com/music/listen#/ps/I26tzdf7n6acqbddz367qqjbopa">Here is the podcast on Google Play</a> and here is a link to the GP <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?feed=podcast">RSS feed</a>.</p>
<p>Hosts: <a href="https://twitter.com/rainmaker0000lariat/status/685283024099913728">Josh</a>, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/rutskarn?ty=c">Rutskarn</a>, <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/">Shamus</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Campster">Campster</a>,  <a href="http://mumblesbot.tumblr.com/">Mumbles</a>. </p>
<p>Episode edited by <a href="http://www.blueberrystarstudio.com/site/">Rachel</a>.</p>
<p>Show notes: <span id="more-33637"></span></p>
<p><strong>1:00: We compare Chris to Strong Sad.</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t know anything about Homestar Runner, then this video probably won’t even begin to help you to have an inkling of an iota of a notion of what you’re missing. But it’s got Strong Sad in it, and that’s what’s important for the purposes of our discussion.</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>4:05: Diecast on Google Play and iTunes.</strong></p>
<p>To submit to Google Play / iTunes, you need a custom RSS feed with their company-specific special-snowflake tags added. Assuming you have better things to do than manually generate your own RSS feed (or write and maintain integrated WordPress plugins to do same) then this means using an existing WordPress plugin. The one I’m using is the best I found. (Read: Simplest to enable and roll out on an existing site. Most plugins seem to be written with the assumption that your blog BRAND NEW and ONLY for the podcast and thus everything should be added to the RSS feed.) But this one comes with its own player and problems and frustrations. </p>
<p>Anyway. If you’re a Google Play user then please let me know if it works like it should. If you have any advice for adding the show to iTunes without needing to install stupid iTunes on my PC, I’d love to hear it. If not, then it sounds like Mumbles can take care of it.</p>
<p>I’m asking this on the show because I don’t use RSS, I don’t listen to podcasts, I don’t use Google Play, and I don’t do very much with mobile devices, so there’s no way I’ll know if I’ve gotten it wrong.</p>
<p><strong>7:55: Star Trek Beyond</strong></p>
<p>Here’s the Twitter fit I threw last year when the first trailer came out, along with the trailer in question:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" >
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Okay, which one of you swaggering Gorn-faced morons asked Hollywood to turn Trek into Fast and the Furious in space?<a href="https://t.co/POWqQC5XCS">https://t.co/POWqQC5XCS</a></p>
<p>— Shamus Young (@shamusyoung) <a href="https://twitter.com/shamusyoung/status/676491555369312256">December 14, 2015</a></p></blockquote>

<p>But like I said in some follow-up tweets, I’ve long since made peace with the fact that Trek movies are just action films now. I’m okay with that as long as they’re GOOD. (Which both Josh and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nfEprhrXGQ">Moviebob</a> say this one is.)</p>
<p><strong>25:48: Suicide Squad</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>34:47: Telltale Batman</strong></p>
<p><strong>52:14: Humble Monthly Bundle</strong></p>
<p>Here is remote control Claptrap the Mumbles talked about:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-video" >
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">What does a gentleman say? <a href="https://t.co/9U59QVq02L">pic.twitter.com/9U59QVq02L</a></p>

If you don’t know anything about Homestar Runner, then this video probably won’t even begin to help you to have an inkling of an iota of a notion of what you’re missing. But it’s got Strong Sad in it, and that’s what’s important for the purposes of our discussion.




4:05: Diecast on Google Play and iTunes.

To submit to Google Play / iTunes, you need a custom RSS feed with their company-specific special-snowflake tags added. Assuming you have better things to do than manually generate your own RSS feed (or write and maintain integrated WordPress plugins to do same) then this means using an existing WordPress plugin. The one I’m using is the best I found. (Read: Simplest to enable and roll out on an existing site. Most plugins seem to be written with the assumption that your blog BRAND NEW and ONLY for the podcast and thus everything should be added to the RSS feed.) But this one comes with its own player and problems and frustrations. 

Anyway. If you’re a Google Play user then please let me know if it works like it should. If you have any advice for adding the show to iTunes without needing to install stupid iTunes on my PC, I’d love to hear it. If not, then it sounds like Mumbles can take care of it.

I’m asking this on the show because I don’t use RSS, I don’t listen to podcasts, I don’t use Google Play, and I don’t do very much with mobile devices, so there’s no way I’ll know if I’ve gotten it wrong.

7:55: Star Trek Beyond

Here’s the Twitter fit I threw last year when the first trailer came out, along with the trailer in question:


Okay, which one of you swaggering Gorn-faced morons asked Hollywood to turn Trek into Fast and the Furious in space?https://t.co/POWqQC5XCS
— Shamus Young (@shamusyoung) December 14, 2015

But like I said in some follow-up tweets, I’ve long since made peace with the fact that Trek movies are just action films now. I’m okay with that as long as they’re GOOD. (Which both Josh and Moviebob say this one is.)

25:48: Suicide Squad  

34:47: Telltale Batman

52:14: Humble Monthly Bundle

Here is remote control Claptrap the Mumbles talked about:

16:01 FTL has been updated and is more interesting now.

To clarify: The update is “new” in the sense of being new to me. It was actually released ages ago. (A couple of years, according to the comments.)

20:40 Josh goes on a rant about Adobe products and their bone-headed keymapping feature.

24:00 Scary games / Not Scary Games

33:19 Starbound




52:34 Mailbag: Rutskarn’s made-up internet name.

Dear Rutskarn,
What is the proper pronunciation of your name?  Your fellow casters call you Rut-skarn (or Butt-skarn) but when you introduce yourself when hosting you say Root-skarn.
Best Regards,
Jared
53:54 Mailbag: Details vs. Drama

Dear Shamus/Diecast, 
In your Mass Effect Retrospective, you discussed details-first vs drama-first storytelling. However, you only spoke of this topic within sci-fi settings. Is it possible to tell a details-first fantasy story?
Thank you,

<p>Since I asked for recommendations, I guess I should make clear what I’m looking for in a Match-3 game: 1) Focus on planning ahead and setting up deliberate moves. 2) NO TIMER. I like working with a limited number of moves, but being allowed to consider those moves for as long as I like. 3) Ideally, there would be some sort of meta-game. 4) Preferably something without naked anime girls.</p>
<p>Also, this discusses quasi-pornography. I’d encourage everyone to be respectful. Remember that one person’s “tame cheesecake” is another person’s “sick filth”.

Try not to be crappy to each other. </p>
<p>Also, I’d like to say how happy I am that I can use the phrase “naked anime girls” without worrying that the Google smut-bot is going to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10caMf8ZRX8">throw a fit</a>. </p>

<strong>00:23 Team Fortress 2 vs. Overwatch</strong></p>
<p>Here is the “upcoming” (now released) video Chris kept alluding to during the discussion:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>39:14 The Room</strong></p>
<p>This is talking about a puzzle game about opening doors and boxes, which sounds lame but actually looks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syiha-lS04g">really appealing</a>. The game “The Room” has nothing to do with the developer “The Chinese Room”, although in one of our many nested tangents we manage to talk about exactly that…</p>
<p><strong>49:00 The Chinese Room</strong></p>
<p>We spend a lot of time talking about Dear Esther and the degree to which it did / didn’t work, and why. Here’s <a href="http://innuendostudios.tumblr.com/post/140706329877/the-first-of-my-new-series-on-interactive">the analysis from Innuendo Studios</a> that Chris mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>1:05:03 VA-11 Hall-A</strong></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>We start off talking about the game, but then move onto the more important topic of “If each of us was turned into a videogame, what would it be?”</p>

00:23 Team Fortress 2 vs. Overwatch

Here is the “upcoming” (now released) video Chris kept alluding to during the discussion:




39:14 The Room

This is talking about a puzzle game about opening doors and boxes, which sounds lame but actually looks really appealing. The game “The Room” has nothing to do with the developer “The Chinese Room”, although in one of our many nested tangents we manage to talk about exactly that…

49:00 The Chinese Room

We spend a lot of time talking about Dear Esther and the degree to which it did / didn’t work, and why. Here’s the analysis from Innuendo Studios that Chris mentioned.

1:05:03 VA-11 Hall-A




We start off talking about the game, but then move onto the more important topic of “If each of us was turned into a videogame, what would it be?”

Dear Diecast,
We often praise games for trying something new, but it doesn’t always work out. What is your favorite/most interesting failure of a game?

<p>I’ve watched some gameplay on YouTube since then, and it looks very different. It’s much more about gathering resources and weapons and less about having your head messed with.

@shamusyoung Since modding isn’t something that you really cover on spoiler warning. What are some mods that you love or would like to see?

@shamusyoung My family doesn’t understand that there’s a difference between &quot;working from home&quot; and &quot;being on vacation.&quot;
— Edith (@micamoan) June 12, 2016


@shamusyoung Shamus, any advice for getting them to understand that I have a schedule and I’m not free to just do whatever they want?

Dear Diecast,
What do you make of Valve’s recent announcement that they have teamed up with Lionsgate to bring films to Steam?   Do you think other film studios will follow suit?  Could Valve succeed in morfing Steam into a real iTunes competitor, and if so, would that upset gamers?

Have any of you tried the new survival mode for Fallout 4, if so, what are your thoughts?

44:44 Mailbag: The Silmarillion  

Hello Diecast!
Shamus, you are the foremost expert on the Lord or The Rings, judging by how eloquently you analyze it as well as by how many copies of the book you have used up over the years.
Have you read any of the other Middle-Earth material, like the Silmarillion or the Short Stories? If so, how do they compare to the Hobbit and LOTR?
Regards,
Matthias
47:30 Mailbag: Violence

Dear Diecast,
What do you think of the fact that violence, usually killing and being killed, is the primary way the player interacts with the universe in most games, and do you think that has had any spillover effect on other media?  
I kept wondering about that after finally seeing the new Star Wars and being bugged by how many people the heroes kill onscreen, as opposed to being in far-off explosions or the camera cutting away before the killing blow, like what happens with most of the villains’ kills.  The amount of points where the protagonists are stuck in a place where they just have to kill everybody else in the area to proceed just felt like a videogame.

<strong>01:08 Shamus is up for a Hugo Award</strong></p>
<p>Here I talk about the fact that <a href="http://midamericon2.org/home/hugo-awards-and-wsfs/2016-hugo-finalists/">I’ve been nominated for a Hugo</a>, and I briefly mention the controversy the Hugos have been having for the past two years. I don’t want to talk about the controversy here. In fact, the <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=31891">no politics post</a> was written specifically in anticipation of this discussion. </p>
<p>If you’re looking for more information: On WIRED there’s this post entitled <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/10/hugo-awards-controversy/">Sci-Fi's Hugo Awards and the Battle for Pop Culture's Soul</a>, which seems to be the one everyone links when trying to bring people up to speed on this. However, like a lot of Wired articles this one feels like the author was paid by the word. It’s long on anecdotes, it takes forever to get to the point, it’s broad and hyperbolic, and for all the words it spends it never feels like it gets down to details. </p>
<p>I found this one much more useful: <a href="https://www.blackgate.com/2015/04/04/a-detailed-explanation/">A Detailed Explanation</a> by Matthew David Surridge, explaining why he declined his Hugo nomination last year. It is also long – I’m afraid you can’t really do the topic justice in a couple of paragraphs – but instead of spending its word count on stories, he just takes up one side and argues for it. In the process he kind of maps out a good deal of both sides<span class="snote" title="1">Calling it “both sides” is something of a misnomer. There are a lot more than two viewpoints here, and you can’t really fame it as two clear-cut groups without making simplifications and generalizations that will very likely piss some people off.</span>. </p>
<p>I’m excited to be nominated for a Hugo. I’m excited that videogames are being recognized and encouraged in their pursuit of sci-fi stories. I’m dreading dealing with people who don’t respect my no politics rule and are just looking for an opportunity to unleash the anger they’re hauling around. I think accepting the nomination is the most diplomatic thing to do, and win or lose I’m grateful for everyone who thinks my work has merit.</p>
<p><strong>11:18 Fallout Mods.</strong></p>
<p>It’s pretty hard to discuss the Fallout modding scene without slipping into yet another enumeration of the shortcomings of Fallout 4. We tried.</p>
<p><strong>29:45 Mailbag: Sc-fi is sometimes hard.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Dice Wizards,</p>
<p>Writers often create characters, species, or races lacking some essential part of what makes us human, ie. no emotions, sense of pain, fear of death, no body in the sense that we think of it, individuality, sexual desire, etc.</p>
<p>Since these characters often still tend to think and act like humans do, do you think writers and actors, as regular lifelong humans, are any good at imagining and portraying beings that lack important parts of what drives our thoughts and actions?</p>
<p>Thanks.<br>
Jakale</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>50:31 Mailbag: What would YOU do with an $80 million game budget?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>A hypothetical AAA entity who likes The Diecast offers to put you (the collective crew of the Diecast) in charge of a AAA game with a budget of, let’s say, 80 million USD. Let’s pretend you have full creative control and that you accept the offer (though whether you would is also an interesting question). What do you make? To what degree do you play it safe or push the envelope? How do you allocate your resources?</p>
<p>Live long &amp; prosper,</p>
<p>Erich T. Wade</p></blockquote>
<p>I have to give Erich credit for a well-constructed question. This setup anticipated all the ways in which we would attempt to weasel out of answering it.</p>
<p><strong>1:00:50 Mailbag: EA Convention</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>A while back, Shamus and Josh were talking about how EA and somebody else weren’t having E3 booths any more because it wasn’t worth the expense for them. </p>
<p>Rather than having a presence at a general game show like E3 or a PAX, do you think it would make sense for somebody like EA to run their own show, Blizzcon-style?</p>

Show notes: 
01:08 Shamus is up for a Hugo Award

Here I talk about the fact that I’ve been nominated for a Hugo, and I briefly mention the controversy the Hugos have been having for the past two years. I don’t want to talk about the controversy here. In fact, the no politics post was written specifically in anticipation of this discussion. 

If you’re looking for more information: On WIRED there’s this post entitled Sci-Fi’s Hugo Awards and the Battle for Pop Culture’s Soul, which seems to be the one everyone links when trying to bring people up to speed on this. However, like a lot of Wired articles this one feels like the author was paid by the word. It’s long on anecdotes, it takes forever to get to the point, it’s broad and hyperbolic, and for all the words it spends it never feels like it gets down to details. 

I found this one much more useful: A Detailed Explanation by Matthew David Surridge, explaining why he declined his Hugo nomination last year. It is also long – I’m afraid you can’t really do the topic justice in a couple of paragraphs – but instead of spending its word count on stories, he just takes up one side and argues for it. In the process he kind of maps out a good deal of both sidesCalling it “both sides” is something of a misnomer. There are a lot more than two viewpoints here, and you can’t really fame it as two clear-cut groups without making simplifications and generalizations that will very likely piss some people off.. 

I’m excited to be nominated for a Hugo. I’m excited that videogames are being recognized and encouraged in their pursuit of sci-fi stories. I’m dreading dealing with people who don’t respect my no politics rule and are just looking for an opportunity to unleash the anger they’re hauling around. I think accepting the nomination is the most diplomatic thing to do, and win or lose I’m grateful for everyone who thinks my work has merit.

11:18 Fallout Mods.

It’s pretty hard to discuss the Fallout modding scene without slipping into yet another enumeration of the shortcomings of Fallout 4. We tried.

29:45 Mailbag: Sc-fi is sometimes hard.

Dear Dice Wizards,
Writers often create characters, species, or races lacking some essential part of what makes us human, ie. no emotions, sense of pain, fear of death, no body in the sense that we think of it, individuality, sexual desire, etc.
Since these characters often still tend to think and act like humans do, do you think writers and actors, as regular lifelong humans, are any good at imagining and portraying beings that lack important parts of what drives our thoughts and actions?
Thanks.
Jakale
50:31 Mailbag: What would YOU do with an $80 million game budget?

A hypothetical AAA entity who likes The Diecast offers to put you (the collective crew of the Diecast) in charge of a AAA game with a budget of, let’s say, 80 million USD. Let’s pretend you have full creative control and that you accept the offer (though whether you would is also an interesting question). What do you make? To what degree do you play it safe or push the envelope? How do you allocate your resources?
Live long &amp; prosper,
Erich T. Wade
I have to give Erich credit for a well-constructed question. This setup anticipated all the ways in which we would attempt to weasel out of answering it.

1:00:50 Mailbag: EA Convention

A while back, Shamus and Josh were talking about how EA and somebody else weren’t having E3 booths any more because it wasn’t worth the expense for them. 
Rather than having a presence at a general game show like E3 or a PAX, do you think it would make sense for somebody like EA to run their own show, Blizzcon-style?

<p>Related to Wrasslin’, I saw this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYvMOf3hsGA">Wrestling isn’t Wrestling</a> by Max Landis, and I found it charming as hell.

<p>The video introduces the story-driven drama of wrestling by telling the 20-year history of Triple H. It tells the story with all of the wrestler genders flipped, which is fun and hilarious.

<p>Be on the lookout for other names that should be familiar, even if you don’t know anything about wrestling.

For me, it’s always like this.

Last week there was a bit of controversy on Spoiler Warning. If you don’t watch the show or don’t read the comments then you probably won’t have the context for this. Basically, Mumbles made some jokes about torturing robots, some other people objected, and then Mumbles recorded this:

During the show, when she said she was sick of the female coach character, it hit on something I’d been thinking about for weeks, which was the series of design decisions that led to this trope. So as she commented on it, I reflexively went, “Oh, here’s a segue into that thing I’ve been thinking about!” So then I tried to talk about it on the spot, and halfway into it I realized it was too big and complicated to cover on the showThis actually happens pretty often. I should rename my column, “Random Shit That Didn’t Fit on Spoiler Warning.”. I ended up turning it into my weekly column. But then that dumped even more aggro on Mumbles. (Sorry Mumbles.)

Hopefully this clears everything up and puts the controversy to rest. This is supposed to be fun.

Dude, that shirt is in shockingly poor taste.

Above is the quote that got all the attention in the original WSJ article, but for me THIS quote is the one that really raised my eyebrows:

“I was surprised with the fervency of the defense of the concept of Superman. I feel like they were taking it personally that I was trying to grow up their character.”

00:20:55 Daredevil

Like I said in the show, this is on my to-watch list as soon as this Good Robot business is over. 

31:30 Rutskarn’s Tales of D&amp;D Tomfoolery.

<span id="more-31032"></span><strong>00:01:00 Microsoft and Windows 10 Store Shenanigans</strong></p>
<p>Here is Tim Sweeny, literally <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/04/microsoft-monopolise-pc-games-development-epic-games-gears-of-war">calling on people to fight the Microsoft initiative</a>. If there’s one critique I have for Sweeny, it’s that I think bringing up the Microsoft antitrust lawsuit is a mistake in this context. That case was really complex and doesn’t come off as the scathing condemnation he intends it to. If you’re trying to persuade an undecided audience to join your cause, doing so under a controversial banner only limits your reach. If you’re arguing tax policy, don’t try to bolster your argument with arguments that require the reader agree with you on (say) abortion. You’re just going to thread-jack your own argument, and people will debate the controversial thing instead of examining the new thing you’re trying to get them to care about. </p>
<p>For example, now that I’ve mentioned the antitrust suit, people are going to be tempted to bring it up here, so I need to head them off with this: <em>This is not about the [lack of?] merit of the antitrust lawsuit and if you try to argue about it here you are the debate equivalent of a cat chasing a laser pointer. Let’s keep the conversation focused on Microsoft’s shenanigans in 2016.</em></p>
<p>I think you can make a really good case against UWP on simple practical grounds as a consumer, and that doesn’t require agreement on the antitrust case, which was a debate that took thousands of different viewpoints and tried to shove them into simple boxes labeled “for” and “against”. </p>
<p>Also, since we mentioned Jill of the Jungle, I have to link to this. I fell in love with this game back in the day, despite the fact that I don’t really enjoy 2D sidescrolling platformers. This game won me over with presentation and soundtrack. (Mostly soundtrack.)</p>

<p>As we recorded this, Mumbles was getting over being sick. And while I didn’t know it at the time, I was just a few hours from becoming annoyingly sick myself. </p>
<p>Show notes: <span id="more-30875"></span></p>
<p><strong>00:02:00: Oxenfree</strong></p>
<p>Mild spoilers. Mumbles says somethign vague about the ending or whatever.<br>

<p><strong>00:11:30: Devil Daggers</strong></p>
<p>I don’t think this trailer really sells the game all that well. It’s much more hectic than what you see here:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>Spoiler: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSoRbNs9bDk">Here is the video that ruined the game for me</a>. It’s someone playing for 8 minutes. Once I saw that, I kind of felt like my own one-minute scores were too sad to continue working on.</p>
<p><strong>00:19:30: Star Wars Novel: Lost Stars </strong></p>
<p>Here is <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25067046-star-wars">a link to the book on GoodReads</a>. </p>
<p><strong>00:24:45: X-Com 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>00:28:30: Josh got a mechanical keyboard.</strong></p>
<p>We compared keyboards in the diecast. For the record, here is mine in rainbow mode:</p>
<p></p><table border="0" class="nomargin" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/images/keyboard1.jpg?189db0&amp;189db0" class="imagefull" alt="I don't actually use rainbow mode.

Boringly, I mostly stick to pure white."></td></tr><tr><td class="insetcaptionx"><p class="mouseover_alt">I don't actually use rainbow mode. Boringly, I mostly stick to pure white.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
<p>You can also see the purple Halloween lights I have strung around under my desk, in case you thought I was kidding when I talked about that on Spoiler Warning.</p>
<p>I hate looking down at the keyboard and seeing crud, dust, and crumbs. My previous keyboard was black, and sometimes I’d have a massive OCD fit and tear the thing apart to clean all the gunk out. This keyboard doesn’t have a frame around it, which means it should be easier to clean. (If I blast it with compressed air, the debris will leave the device instead of going deeper in.</p>
<p><strong>00:34:15: Shamus goes on a strange digression about raging out.</strong></p>
<p>Sorry for interrupting Josh’s keyboard talk. I know this feels kind of out of place on the show. This is something I’ve wanted to write about for ages, but… didn’t. So then the subject came up and I couldn’t help talking about it.</p>
<p>If you suffer from fits of rage like I used to, I hope some of my rambling advice is helpful to you. Just remember: Your goal isn’t to stop being angry. That’s impossible and will actually only make things worse. Your goal should be getting the anger out in non-destructive ways. A good secondary goal is to experiment with your diet and medications and see if you can identify something that exacerbates the problem. </p>
<p>Thanks to the rest of the cast for humoring this digression.</p>

Episode edited by Josh.

As we recorded this, Mumbles was getting over being sick. And while I didn’t know it at the time, I was just a few hours from becoming annoyingly sick myself. 

Show notes: 

00:02:00: Oxenfree

Mild spoilers. Mumbles says somethign vague about the ending or whatever.



Here is the post Mumbles did about the Oxenfree soundtrack.

00:11:30: Devil Daggers

I don’t think this trailer really sells the game all that well. It’s much more hectic than what you see here:




Spoiler: Here is the video that ruined the game for me. It’s someone playing for 8 minutes. Once I saw that, I kind of felt like my own one-minute scores were too sad to continue working on.

00:19:30: Star Wars Novel: Lost Stars 

Here is a link to the book on GoodReads. 

00:24:45: X-Com 2

00:28:30: Josh got a mechanical keyboard.

We compared keyboards in the diecast. For the record, here is mine in rainbow mode:


I don’t actually use rainbow mode. Boringly, I mostly stick to pure white.

You can also see the purple Halloween lights I have strung around under my desk, in case you thought I was kidding when I talked about that on Spoiler Warning.

I hate looking down at the keyboard and seeing crud, dust, and crumbs. My previous keyboard was black, and sometimes I’d have a massive OCD fit and tear the thing apart to clean all the gunk out. This keyboard doesn’t have a frame around it, which means it should be easier to clean. (If I blast it with compressed air, the debris will leave the device instead of going deeper in.

00:34:15: Shamus goes on a strange digression about raging out.

Sorry for interrupting Josh’s keyboard talk. I know this feels kind of out of place on the show. This is something I’ve wanted to write about for ages, but… didn’t. So then the subject came up and I couldn’t help talking about it.

If you suffer from fits of rage like I used to, I hope some of my rambling advice is helpful to you. Just remember: Your goal isn’t to stop being angry. That’s impossible and will actually only make things worse. Your goal should be getting the anger out in non-destructive ways. A good secondary goal is to experiment with your diet and medications and see if you can identify something that exacerbates the problem. 

Thanks to the rest of the cast for humoring this digression.

00:40:30: SUPER HOT




00:50:00: Good Trends


@Rutskarn People talk a lot about bad trends in video games; what recent trends in video games do you want to see more of?

00:38:42: Do bad games make good games better?

Dear Diecast,
So I have actually kinda cathartically enjoyed a couple different critiques on Bethesda’s Fallout 4. Its a really fun problem to have, since the issues Bethesda has introduced seem to be based on huge misunderstanding of the franchise. But in a way it also does shine a light on the games that did understand its franchise right, and thats what I wanted to know about. Do franchises benefit from having a few bad apples, in order to make the other works feel more special. Is that why we cherish New Vegas as a return to form? Are there any other franchises that have benefitted from having bad works? I think Star Wars could be one.
Questionably,
James
00:49:02: Extemporaneous self-insert surprise question!

Dear Diecast,
Can you think of any games that broke from their old style and were just as good (or better for it) after being re-invented.

Last year you raised some understandable doubts about Square Enix’s plans for the release of Hitman, particularly because of the lack of available details.
However, in mid January, Square Enix published an article containing some details that might change your perspective.

<p><strong>0:00:50: Defense Grid 2</strong> </p>
<p>Protip: You can turn the dialog volume all the way down and play this as a plotless tower defense game. I feel bad about doing so, but <em>damn</em> does that dialog drag on.</p>

Show notes: 

0:00:50: Defense Grid 2 

Protip: You can turn the dialog volume all the way down and play this as a plotless tower defense game. I feel bad about doing so, but damn does that dialog drag on.

0:13:05: Naval Action

0:19:50: Rainbow  Six Siege




0:27:05: Rise Of The Tomb Raider

It’s not that the story sucks, it’s that it gets too much focus. These mechanics are really strong, and I think the game should be more confident about leaving us to enjoy them for longer. Also, like I said the other day:

<p>Is this the first time Mumbles has hosted? I think it is! And I wasn’t there to see it.</p>
<p>Since I wasn’t in the show, I put my thoughts in the show notes below.</p>
<p>Show notes:<span id="more-30199"></span><br>
<strong>1:00: Powerball</strong></p>
<p>For the curious: I’ve never bought a lottery ticket of any kind in my whole life. Having said that, I’m not one of those people who likes to mock people for playing the lottery. It’s just that my gambling takes a different form. Instead of wasting a couple of dollars for an <em>extremely</em> astronomical chance at success, I risk hundreds or thousands of hours of my life on projects (books, comics, game development) for a <em>mildly</em> astronomical chance at success. Who is the bigger dumbass? I don’t think it’s that clear-cut. </p>
<p>And like a lottery player, I don’t play because I expect to win. I play because I enjoy the experience of playing. Although now that I have <a href="https://www.patreon.com/shamusyoung?ty=h">Patreon</a> it feels less like a random gamble and more like a sane investment. </p>
<p>So, thanks, by the way. </p>
<p><strong>3:08: Oculus Rift</strong></p>
<p>My column this week will discuss this.</p>
<p><strong>21:35: Amplitude</strong></p>
<p>It’s only recently that I became aware of how horrible I am at multi-tasking. I can’t listen and do something at the same time. If I’m playing a game, I have to pause. Earlier in our marriage I overestimated my multitasking capacity. I’d try to listen and play at the same time, and end up doing that “half listening” thing. Something like:</p>
<p>Heather: I’m going to the store. I left a cake in the oven. Can you take it out in twenty minutes?</p>
<p>Me: (Pause for several seconds, staring fixedly at the screen.) Yeah. Cake. Twenty minutes.</p>
<p>And then later she comes home and the cake is a brick of carbon. She asks me about it, and I barely remember the earlier conversation at all.</p>
<p>This is why I don’t stream, even though that would be a fun thing to do. A Shamus Twitch Stream would just be me playing, mostly in silence. Once in  a while I’d say something like, “I like fighting these…. shit. (pause.) These skeleton guys are interesting bec- shit. Hang on. (Five minutes of silence.) So anyway… the… skeleton guys… are very… interesting because… <em>Oh shit that was a lot of XP.</em> because… they… the skeletons, I mean… they’re interesting when you… aw damn it!  When you have, like… When you’re fighting them but you also…”</p>
<p>Yeah. It wouldn’t be entertaining. I actually have to concentrate really hard when I listen and speak, which probably explains why my social development <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=12853">lagged so far behind other kids</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast:</p>
<p>Though Dark Souls is known for being hard, it is also known for its aesthetic. One aspect where I really appreciated the attention to detail was in the voice acting for the player character: In most games, when the player character gets hurt, you hear a fairly unbelieveable “ouch” or “oof” just to alert you, but Dark Souls makes it sound like your character is really in pain! (Particularly if you choose a female character)</p>
<p>Do you think other games are as deliberate about not doing what Dark Souls is deliberate about doing? Obviously we don’t want to be seriously concerned about, say, Mario’s wellbeing when he touches a goomba, but in the endless supply of World War 2 shooters, the voice acting is suprisingly lacking. Is this an example of most games failing to be realistic, or an example where we really shouldn’t have realism as a goal?</p>

Mumbles went on her honeymoon last week, and she went to Disney Land / World. I said I didn’t know the difference. So she explained. 

I still don’t know the difference. She tried.

<p>Whoops. Rachel left about four minutes of dead air on the tail end of the podcast. In her defense, she edited the show while sick, and her computer crashed and forced her to start over at the halfway point. I figured it was better to let it slide than to wake her up and make her re-encode the whole thing. You understand.</p>

Hosts: Josh, Shamus, Mumbles. Episode edited by Rachel.

Whoops. Rachel left about four minutes of dead air on the tail end of the podcast. In her defense, she edited the show while sick, and her computer crashed and forced her to start over at the halfway point. I figured it was better to let it slide than to wake her up and make her re-encode the whole thing. You understand.

Show notes:

00:00:34: Rise of The Tomb R-HEY EVERYONE FALLOUT 4 IS OUT!

I’d like to temper my commentary on the game a little. Yesterday on Twitter I said:


Woo. Just beat #Fallout4!

It’s the best bits of New Vegas, with the best bits of Skyrim. My new favorite in… whatever we call this genre.

I think rather than being the “best of both games”, it’s more like we finally got a game that avoids the crippling failures of both. It might sound like I’m splitting hairs, but bear with me. I think this is an important distinction.

Fallout 4 gets pretty schlocky in parts, but it’s not the brain-melting idiocy of Fallout 3. The plot is more engaging than the battle against time-traveling dragons that somehow managed to come off as dull in Skyrim. It’s a little rough around the edges like all Gamebryo games, but it’s not nearly as buggy as New Vegas. 

So I shouldn’t have implied this is the best of the bunch. More like it’s the one with the least severe flaws. The whole product seems to be converging on a point of adequacy. 

So. Yeah. Don’t run out and buy it because Shamus promised you story better than New Vegas. 

00:04:30: Fallout 4 Game Engine tied to framerate.

The video I mentioned:




00:07:44: Rise of the Tomb Raider

Poor Crystal Dynamics. We’ll catch up with them once the game comes out for real.

00:12:50: Fallout 4 again. For basically the rest of the show.




00:32:00: Fallout 4 will probably be the next season of Spoiler Warning.

I know we usually give a game a year, but unless there’s a huge backlash Fallout 4 will happen in just a couple of months.

<p>Hope you had a fun Halloween. Here is an hour of us talking about videogames. </p>

<p></p><p></p>
<p>Oof. Right in the feels. </p>
<p><strong>00:40:05 Tomb Raider releases on Tuesday.</strong></p>
<p>Opposite Fallout 4. And Starcraft: Legacy of the Void. And the latest Call of Duty. And it’s a platform exclusive. To the Xbox.</p>
<p>Sigh. I guess we’ll see how it turned out in a year.</p>
<p><strong>00:57:29 Bob Ross and the joy of positive content on the internet.</strong></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>I actually worry a lot about negativity. I don’t want to be known as That One Guy Who Hates Everything. Also, red-faced nerdrage attracts a more… energetic audience. While stuff like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFD2293oGvA">MovieBob’s ten-minute evisceration of Pixels</a> is insanely popular, it’s not the kind of thing I’d want to be known for. I actually think it would be bad for my outlook on life. While the initial salvo might be cathartic, I imaging there’s a pretty strong feedback loop going on that would make it miserable to produce that kind of content over the long haul. </p>
<p>But on the other hand, it’s pretty hard to have an all-positive show all the time. I have no idea how to make one. Explaining why something doesn’t work is usually a lot more complex than explaining why it does, so negative topics are usually more interesting. The Activision topic is a good example. If Activision did something ordinary and financially sound, then what would be the point of discussing it? Why bring it up? This isn’t a news show, it’s a commentary show. </p>
<p>What I’m getting at is: I love positive content and upbeat personalities. If given the choice, that’s the kind of space I’d prefer to occupy. But the engineer in me wants to troubleshoot problems. This site is basically the balance between those two opposing forces. </p>

31:00: Mailbag: Nintendrives!

Dear Diecast,
Nintendo recently filed a patent for a game console without a disk drive.  While that certainly isn’t the same as officially announcing such a console it still seems like big news.  Thoughts?

39:15 Mailbag: Fun ammo!

Dear Diecast,
Limited ammunition is one of the most common mechanics in video games, but it’s never seemed that interesting to me.  It’s only ever used to gate off certain weapons from use by not providing ammo for them, or to provide tension when the player has very little ammo left, but if you ever run out of all your ammo, then you just can’t play anymore.  Ammo seems to be at most just a hindrance to having fun.
My question is, are there any games that make ammo fun, if not, is there a way to make ammo a fun mechanic, or should ammo go the way of health in modern shooters, and just regenerate over time?

<strong>00:46 Human Resource Machine.</strong></p>
<p>Update: On the show I said I wanted to see how a non-coder would take to this game. I got it for <a href="http://www.blueberrystarstudio.com/">Rachel</a> last night, and she’s plowing through it. So it’s totally playable for people who have never coded before. Although now that I think of it, Rachel has done fairly extensive work with Minecraft command blocks, which probably gave her a good starting framework. Still, I think I can recommend this game unconditionally for both coders and non-coders. Which is pretty amazing. </p>
<p>I’ll probably have a follow-up post on this at some point to ask what people thought of it. </p>
<p><strong>13:02 Left-handed people and video games.</strong></p>
<p>Fun trivia: The Diecast is 40% left-handers. (Mumbles and Chris.)</p>
<p><strong>25:46 Mass Effect 3: Citadel DLC.</strong></p>
<p>Also we talk about Frank Miller for reasons that will only make sense in retrospect.</p>

Show notes: 
00:46 Human Resource Machine.

Update: On the show I said I wanted to see how a non-coder would take to this game. I got it for Rachel last night, and she’s plowing through it. So it’s totally playable for people who have never coded before. Although now that I think of it, Rachel has done fairly extensive work with Minecraft command blocks, which probably gave her a good starting framework. Still, I think I can recommend this game unconditionally for both coders and non-coders. Which is pretty amazing. 

I’ll probably have a follow-up post on this at some point to ask what people thought of it. 

13:02 Left-handed people and video games.

Fun trivia: The Diecast is 40% left-handers. (Mumbles and Chris.)

25:46 Mass Effect 3: Citadel DLC.

Also we talk about Frank Miller for reasons that will only make sense in retrospect.

50:32 Crimson peak

Episode edited by <a href="http://www.blueberrystarstudio.com/">Rachel</a>.<p></p>
<p>Reader Jared recently went through the Diecast archives – all 119 episodes – and noted who was there and who hosted. This resulted in some interesting trivia:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shamus has attended 116 episodes and hosted 49 episodes.<br>
Josh has attended 117 episodes, partially attended 1 episode, and hosted 31 episodes.<br>
Chris has attended 108 episodes, hosted 7 episodes, and partially hosted 1 episode.<br>
Rutskarn has attended 75 episodes, partially attended 5 episodes, hosted 30 episodes, and partially hosted 1 episode.<br>
Mumbles has attended 44 episodes, partially attended 1 episode, and partially hosted 2 episodes.<br>
Jarenth has attended 10 episodes.<br>
SuperBunnyHop has attended 3 episodes.<br>
Krellin and PushingUpRoses have both attended 2 episodes.<br>
Arvind, Randy, and Glitch have each been in 1 episode.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks to Jared for putting that together.</p>

Josh has attended 117 episodes, partially attended 1 episode, and hosted 31 episodes.
Chris has attended 108 episodes, hosted 7 episodes, and partially hosted 1 episode.
Rutskarn has attended 75 episodes, partially attended 5 episodes, hosted 30 episodes, and partially hosted 1 episode.
Mumbles has attended 44 episodes, partially attended 1 episode, and partially hosted 2 episodes.
Jarenth has attended 10 episodes.
SuperBunnyHop has attended 3 episodes.
Krellin and PushingUpRoses have both attended 2 episodes.
Arvind, Randy, and Glitch have each been in 1 episode.

Thanks to Jared for putting that together.

<p>Did you have trouble getting the Diecast to work with your RSS feed last week? I mistakenly had the download link pointed at “diecast117”, when it should have linked to “diecast117<strong>.mp3</strong>“. I noticed the problem a day later, and “fixed” it by changing the link to “diecast1<strong>7</strong>7.mp3″. I didn’t notice <em>that</em> blunder until Sunday when I write this post.</p>
<p>So, that was a pretty comprehensive failure on my part. Should be fixed now. Or maybe not. I’m probably not the most reliable person to ask, to be honest. But as far as I know, it should all work.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p></p>
<p>Hey, everyone, it’s Rutskarn. I don’t know if you’ve been keeping up with your farmer’s almanac, but the Time of Terror and Blood was recently upon us, and the Great Beast you know as Josh was briefly trapped inside the Southern California ley line. I took advantage of his psychic imprisonment to schedule an ad hoc game of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoia_(role-playing_game)">Paranoia</a>.</em> Unfortunately for you, I recorded it.</p>

      <itunes:summary>Hey, everyone, it’s Rutskarn. I don’t know if you’ve been keeping up with your farmer’s almanac, but the Time of Terror and Blood was recently upon us, and the Great Beast you know as Josh was briefly trapped inside the Southern California ley line. I took advantage of his psychic imprisonment to schedule an ad hoc game of Paranoia. Unfortunately for you, I recorded it.

Also starring: Josh’s brother Glitch, Glitch’s fiancee Madison.

<p><strong>37:00 Romance in videogames.</strong></p>

<p>The added challenge of romance specifically in video games is that every player has unique preferences, so you can’t just make a character “likeable” and call it day. Movies can create chemistry between two characters and the audience accepts that they like each other, but game protagonists are expected to be influenced by the player’s personality. If the protagonist hooks up with someone whom the player is not attracted to, it can feel like an uncomfortable forcing of the hand, even worse for the fact that it puts romance, sex, and “forcing” in the same context.</p>

37:00 Romance in videogames.

Dear Diecast:
As games keep trying to be more like movies, how do think their writers can, should, and actually will address the challenges of more often including romance as a sub-plot (or a primary plot, Catherine for example)?
The added challenge of romance specifically in video games is that every player has unique preferences, so you can’t just make a character “likeable” and call it day. Movies can create chemistry between two characters and the audience accepts that they like each other, but game protagonists are expected to be influenced by the player’s personality. If the protagonist hooks up with someone whom the player is not attracted to, it can feel like an uncomfortable forcing of the hand, even worse for the fact that it puts romance, sex, and “forcing” in the same context.
I look forwarded to hearing each host’s perspective, and perhaps what lessons we can learn from past examples.

<p>This Diecast barely happened. Thanks for Josh and Rutskarn for making the effort to show up when they had so much else going on. Thanks also to my daughter Rachel, who edited this so I could do other stuff. Thanks to everyone who sent in questions. </p>
<p>New record: We made it through half the available questions!</p>
<p>Show notes:<span id="more-27950"></span><br>
<strong>1:00 Early Access for AAA Games?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>how do you think the B:AK launch fiasco would have played out if WB had released the game in it’s current state, *but* at reduced price and clearly labeled as a beta/early access version? That way, people who can run it sufficiently well could already play it, but it would have been clear that the game is far from optimized. I guess you would still get anger from people wanting to play the final version *right now*, and wondering why the consoles get it early.. but at least you would know what you’re getting.</p>
<p>Obviously, they could have also gone the GTA V route and delayed the PC version, but why not give it to people early along with a big warning that it’s not well optimized yet, if they really want it?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Niko</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>13:00 Spoiler Warning of Dragon Age: Origins?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>I’ve long since accepted that we’re never getting a proper Spoiler<br>
Warning season of Dragon Age: Origins. Is there any chance, though, of<br>
some kind of partial season, the way Half-Life 2 was, or the way<br>
Marlow Briggs was supposed to be, so we can at least get to hear your<br>
thoughts over game footage? I know that the Cuftbert muttonchops are<br>
an option for human male characters, so there’s that…</p>
<p>McNutcase</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>25:00 Rando!</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear diecastcast</p>
<p>Artisnal<br>
Hatebasement<br>
Room in the fridge<br>
Bourbon<br>
Loiter</p>
<p>Phill
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>28:00 Tacoma</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on Tacoma, the new game from Fullbright (creators of Gone Home). Do you think the simple walking and examining mechanics can support a larger scale game?</p>
<p>~Ben
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>32:00 Games harmed by additional content.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast Mailbag Black Hole:</p>
<p>Some games frequently receive major post-release content updates, while with others you’re lucky to get a patch for critical bugs. In some cases the updates can change the nature of the original game quite a lot. Have you ever been turned off a game because an update changed something you liked, or only gained interest in a game after new content was added?</p>
<p>-Neko</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>40:00 Participating anonymously. </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Have any of you participated in your own comment sections or forums under alternate pseudonyms? If so, why? I can think of a number of good reasons but I’m curious to hear your experiences. Or those of others in the biz that you know (this may be a good one to reserve for the next time you have a guest).<br>
Sincerely<br>
Frank Stallone</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>50:00 Square Enix has plans for Hitman.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,<br>
Following its announcement at E3, Square Enix has released some details concerning a rather unusual release plan for the new Hitman game. Namely, they plan to release some of the game on December 8th, and continually add to it across 2016.</p>
<p>https://hitman.com/news/announcing-hitman#<br>
https://hitman.com/en-us/news/hitman-q-a#</p>
<p>Do you think this is a good sign for the game’s development, and do you think other AAA Developers may follow this release model?</p>
<p>Yours, Merzendi</p></blockquote>
<p>At some point in the show (I forget where) I mentioned the graphical glitches I found in Shadow of Mordor. In case you’re curious:</p>
<p></p><table border="0" class="nomargin" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/images/shadowofmordor_bug2.jpg?189db0&amp;189db0" class="imagefull" alt="Is this Elven magic or do I need to reboot?" title="Is this Elven magic or do I need to reboot?"></td></tr><tr><td class="insetcaptionx"><p class="mouseover_alt">Is this Elven magic or do I need to reboot?</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>

1:00 Early Access for AAA Games?

how do you think the B:AK launch fiasco would have played out if WB had released the game in it’s current state, *but* at reduced price and clearly labeled as a beta/early access version? That way, people who can run it sufficiently well could already play it, but it would have been clear that the game is far from optimized. I guess you would still get anger from people wanting to play the final version *right now*, and wondering why the consoles get it early.. but at least you would know what you’re getting.
Obviously, they could have also gone the GTA V route and delayed the PC version, but why not give it to people early along with a big warning that it’s not well optimized yet, if they really want it?
Cheers,
Niko
13:00 Spoiler Warning of Dragon Age: Origins?

Dear Diecast,
I’ve long since accepted that we’re never getting a proper Spoiler
Warning season of Dragon Age: Origins. Is there any chance, though, of
some kind of partial season, the way Half-Life 2 was, or the way
Marlow Briggs was supposed to be, so we can at least get to hear your
thoughts over game footage? I know that the Cuftbert muttonchops are
an option for human male characters, so there’s that…
McNutcase
25:00 Rando!

Dear diecastcast
Artisnal
Hatebasement
Room in the fridge
Bourbon
Loiter
Phill

28:00 Tacoma

Dear Diecast
What are your thoughts on Tacoma, the new game from Fullbright (creators of Gone Home). Do you think the simple walking and examining mechanics can support a larger scale game?
~Ben

32:00 Games harmed by additional content.

Dear Diecast Mailbag Black Hole:
Some games frequently receive major post-release content updates, while with others you’re lucky to get a patch for critical bugs. In some cases the updates can change the nature of the original game quite a lot. Have you ever been turned off a game because an update changed something you liked, or only gained interest in a game after new content was added?
-Neko
40:00 Participating anonymously. 

Have any of you participated in your own comment sections or forums under alternate pseudonyms? If so, why? I can think of a number of good reasons but I’m curious to hear your experiences. Or those of others in the biz that you know (this may be a good one to reserve for the next time you have a guest).
Sincerely
Frank Stallone
50:00 Square Enix has plans for Hitman.

Dear Diecast,
Following its announcement at E3, Square Enix has released some details concerning a rather unusual release plan for the new Hitman game. Namely, they plan to release some of the game on December 8th, and continually add to it across 2016.
https://hitman.com/news/announcing-hitman#
https://hitman.com/en-us/news/hitman-q-a#
Do you think this is a good sign for the game’s development, and do you think other AAA Developers may follow this release model?
Yours, Merzendi
At some point in the show (I forget where) I mentioned the graphical glitches I found in Shadow of Mordor. In case you’re curious:


Is this Elven magic or do I need to reboot?


TASTE THE RAINBOW. FIGHT THE RAINBOW.

You can’t see because of the ridiculous bloom lighting, but eventually the rainbow engulfed an entire stronghold. I’m up here on the rooftops, looking down into what should be a city. 


The graphical glitches I can forgive. But the juvenile debasement of Tolkien lore? Not so much.

<p>The problem with “artist renderings” of celestial bodies is that it’s not black-and-white, but a slippery slope.

The original pictures are often comprised of infra-red data, or some other non-visible wavelength. So you have to “re-color” them if you want them to be visible. And so you have some freedom to make aesthetic decisions: “What colors should I use to represent this data?” And from there you can combine two different images – perhaps one is IR data and another is x-rays, and you color each spectrum and then combine them to make these gorgeous composites with lots of color. And you can do some kind of HDR effect to get a huge range of intensity values that will fit in a standard image. Every change makes the data more beautiful and easier to visualize, but also makes it a little less “real” in terms of “what space actually looks like”.  </p>
<p>There’s a gradient of fidelity with “here is the raw telescope output, good luck making sense of it” on one end, and “we think the planet has a lot of ice so we hired an artist to draw Hoth” on the other. </p>

<strong>0:30 Arkham Knight PC release was so bad the the publisher pulled it from shelves.</strong></p>
<p>“Pulled it from shelves”? Pfft. As if they have shelf space for PC games at Gamestop. What is this, 1998?</p>
<p>Josh mentions the story about the <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/batman-arkham-knight-batmobile-edition-canceled-du/1100-6428307/">$200 Batmobile Edition of the game, which was canceled due to “quality control” issues</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a thought experiment: WB plans to sell these crappy Batmobile statues by making them part of the $200 collector’s edition. They plan a run of N thousand statues. There’s a certain overhead to selling mass-produced crap like this, so you need to sell in volume if you want to make money. Then let’s imagine that when the pre-orders roll in, instead of thousands of people ordering the Batmobile edition, they only got a few hundred. There’s no way they can sell just a few hundred of these without losing a ton of money. </p>
<p>If you’re an executive at WB, what do you do? If you’re an idiot you can tell the truth and admit your product is far less popular than you anticipated, and you can piss off fans by going back on the implied promise of a pre-order. You look bad, your product looks bad, and your customers are pissed. Alternatively, you can claim that there are “quality control issues”. This makes it sound like it’s not your fault at all. It’s not you, it’s that crappy factory in China! They made sub-standard products, and you have heroically decided to give up all those sweet pre-orders rather than sell your customers a sub-standard Batmobile.</p>
<p>I want to stress that this a made-up scenario on my part. But my point is that the “quality control” line is the best answer they could possibly give. This answer <em>might</em> be the truth, but it’s also suspiciously the most perfect and expedient deflection of blame they could have offered. I can’t prove – or even seriously <em>allege</em> – anything, but I do find myself looking a this very cynically.</p>

“Pulled it from shelves”? Pfft. As if they have shelf space for PC games at Gamestop. What is this, 1998?

19:00 Chris talks about Amibos.

28:00 GRAPHIX CARDZ!

Josh and Shamus are both upgrading, so it’s time for the biannual rant about the ongoing war between NVIDIA and AMD.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>It’s a mailbag this week! I think we answered around 33% of the questions. I’m starting to think we need to do this more often. Once again, I’ve wiped the slate clean so if your question didn’t make it, it’s time to re-word or re-send if you’re still looking for an answer.</p>
<p>Another week, another apology for wonky audio. I’m really frustrated now because I have the right tools but I keep making dumb newbie mistakes. This week I left a fan on. Not one of those “whisper quiet” fans. And this thing wasn’t sitting across the room from me. This was a roaring box fan, right at my feet. Why? <em>Why did I not turn off the fan</em>?</p>
<p><a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=26779">Audio editing</a> got rid of the worst of it, but the ghost of the sound is still there when I talk. And I’m sure you’ll hear it now that I made a big deal about it. Don’t worry, I’m sure in another 109 episodes or so I’ll figure out how to run this show.</p>

8:00 Design-a-Vault!

23:00 Next Gen.

Dear Diecast
My Question is about “Next Gen”.
So we all know what next generation graphics are going to look like, peers out of the window and sighs.
What does everyone think next generation mechanics should look/play like?
Examples:
If we have “twice the power” of the previous gen, can we render 2 of the previous gen games at once to do strange overlapping levels?
Less polygons more fluid animations?
Being able to create more complex AI or Simulations?
Or just the ability to never have to see a loading screen ever again.

What makes you able to play and enjoy the Witcher 3 or Skyrim, but makes you get stuck in the Hinterlands in Inquisition for hours?

45:00 Books that expand on the lore of a game.

Deer Diecast.
Catching up on the Witcher games and watching the hangout, I noticed how the games make inevitable callbacks to the books.
My question is, what do you think about books that expand on the lore of a videogame? (lumping together videogames based on books and vice versa as well as books accompanying games).
Also if Josh could tell us real quick if the books are worthwile for fans of the witcher games.
Yours,
Ben
This is the SuperBunnyHop that Chris mentioned:

55:00 Ruby Tuesday.

Dear Casters of all things Pod,
Why do video games always come out on Tuesdays? How did that start?

<strong>2:00 Mumbles is reading Batman: Endgame.</strong></p>
<p>CORRECTION: During the conversation I mention a “Think Geek” Loot Crate, but I’m pretty sure <a href="https://www.lootcrate.com/">Loot Crate</a> isn’t affiliated with Think Geek. The deal is that for a small monthly fee (around $12-ish) you get a box of random geek crap supposedly worth $40. I’m sure it’s just overstock stuff some other outfit is trying to unload quickly. It’s the online equivalent of a bargain bin. But it’s also strangely fun. We got it for my son on his birthday, and getting our monthly loot crate is a big deal around here. Everyone gathers around to see what bits of random fandom we got this month. </p>
<p><strong>20:00 Mumbles recommends Lost Constellation.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://finji.itch.io/lost-constellation">You can get it from the official site</a> and is offered on a “name your own price” basis.</p>
<p><strong>22:00 Chris is playing “You Don’t Know Jack”.</strong></p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZcX_ZdlW3Q">the new Errant Signal is out! It’s about GTA V</a>. </p>
<p><strong>28:00 Josh is playing roguelikes.</strong> </p>
<p><a href="http://te4.org/wiki/Tales_of_Maj%27Eyal_Wiki">Tome</a>  </p>
<p><strong>34:00 Shamus isn’t playing much of the videogames.</strong></p>
<p>Instead I’m writing my end-of-year stuff and watching speed runs. Here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SpeedDemosArchiveSDA">Awesome Games Done Quick</a>. But really, I’m a sucker for any Deus Ex or Human Revolution speedruns. I don’t know why, but I love watching this bonkers secret agent save the world through inexplicable nonsense and hilarious stunt-jumping. </p>
<p><strong>37:00 Josh is fighting with Windows.</strong></p>
<p><strong>43:00 Ruts is also playing roguelikes!</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/">Stone Soup Dungeon Crawl</a>.</p>
<p><strong>48:00 Rutskarn is making a new campaign setting.</strong></p>
<p>Also he’s working on his FMV game idea in the margins. Also we talk about rollerblades for a long time. I can’t even explain why. It just happened.</p>
<p><strong>1:13:00 Shamus can do it.</strong></p>
<p>True story: At the one hour 13 minute mark Chris jokes that I could help Rutskarn make this FMV game. I didn’t join in on the joke, because a few minutes earlier Rutkarn had said that he would need to find someone to make the game, or that he would need to program it himself. </p>
<p>That immediately got me thinking, because writing a video player would be monumentally hard for a new coder, but the simple logic that drives a small-scale FMV game would be a fantastic thing for a new coder to work on.  So it seems like you’d need some kind of simplified video player (it would only need to handle one format) that used game logic as a front end. This got me to thinking about the most recent chapter of <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/">Game Programming Patterns</a>, which talked about building a virtual machine to process your own scripting language, so you can handle exactly these kinds of specialized problems where you need artists to be able to code simple things. (The example given in the book is a system where artists could add complex spell effects to the game without needing to get the coders involved. You just need to be able to examine and change stats and create particles.) So I started thinking about scripting languages and what you’d need to be able to do with one in order to drive an FMV game.</p>
<p>Suddenly my name came up in conversation and I had no idea what anyone was talking about. It wasn’t until I edited this episode that I realized I missed the joke about working on the project because I was daydreaming about how one would go about working on the project.</p>
<p><strong>1:16:00 Adventures With Content ID.</strong></p>
<p>Josh tells the story of when we tried to upload the New Year episode of Far Cry 4 and YouTube killed it because the credits used a copyrighted song. </p>

Also he’s working on his FMV game idea in the margins. Also we talk about rollerblades for a long time. I can’t even explain why. It just happened.

1:13:00 Shamus can do it.

True story: At the one hour 13 minute mark Chris jokes that I could help Rutskarn make this FMV game. I didn’t join in on the joke, because a few minutes earlier Rutkarn had said that he would need to find someone to make the game, or that he would need to program it himself. 

That immediately got me thinking, because writing a video player would be monumentally hard for a new coder, but the simple logic that drives a small-scale FMV game would be a fantastic thing for a new coder to work on.  So it seems like you’d need some kind of simplified video player (it would only need to handle one format) that used game logic as a front end. This got me to thinking about the most recent chapter of Game Programming Patterns, which talked about building a virtual machine to process your own scripting language, so you can handle exactly these kinds of specialized problems where you need artists to be able to code simple things. (The example given in the book is a system where artists could add complex spell effects to the game without needing to get the coders involved. You just need to be able to examine and change stats and create particles.) So I started thinking about scripting languages and what you’d need to be able to do with one in order to drive an FMV game.

Suddenly my name came up in conversation and I had no idea what anyone was talking about. It wasn’t until I edited this episode that I realized I missed the joke about working on the project because I was daydreaming about how one would go about working on the project.

1:16:00 Adventures With Content ID.

Josh tells the story of when we tried to upload the New Year episode of Far Cry 4 and YouTube killed it because the credits used a copyrighted song.

Dear diecast/spoiler warning crew,
Have you ever considered doing riff tracks of movies or tv shows?
Umad
And here is the full question that we trimmed down: 

Hi, I’m Daniel (JackTheStripper on your website) and I wanted to ask the Diecast what they think of the current state of educational games.
I grew up playing games like Math Blaster Episode I: In Search of Spot, Math Blaster Mystery: The Great Brain Robbery, Where in The World (and Where in the USA) is Carmen San Diego, and even more classic games like Number Munchers. The fact that they were educational games never bothered me, and the challenge was there. I don’t think I ever beat any of those games on the harder difficulties.
Anyway, games like those are practically non-existent today, and with lots of indie devs bringing games of their childhood back, how is nobody trying to bring back educational games?
Hopefully there’ll be a Diecast in the coming days but I’ll understand if there isn’t with the holidays and all. Big fan of you guys though.
Always ludonarratively dissonant,
Daniel

        <![CDATA[<p>This week we have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pushinguproses">a guest</a> on the show. And since it’s December 22nd, I guess this qualifies our Christmas episode. Sort of. Not that we talk about Christmas. But, you know…. Merry Christmas. Or whatever. </p>

<p>Hosts: <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/">Shamus</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeChuck">Josh</a>, <a href="http://www.chocolatehammer.org/">Rutskarn</a>, <a href="http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/">the other Josh</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pushinguproses">Pushing Up Roses</a>. </p>
<p>Show notes:<span id="more-25420"></span></p>
<p><strong>2:00 Pushing Up Roses talks about her collection of antique computers.</strong></p>
<p>We talk about the IBM 5150, the Tandy 1000, old keyboards, and THIS monstrosity:</p>

<p>If this is their “Deluxe Joystick”, then I’d hate to see what their shitty joysticks look like. Everything about this design is wrong. Let’s zoom in:</p>

<p>The button is a nasty stiff cube with a smooth surface and sharp corners, so you can either rest your thumb on the surface and have it slip off, or push on the edge and let it poke you.

        <![CDATA[<p>Trigger warning: In this episode we talk about mass murder, censorship, and social justice. These are touchy subjects. Just remember to be nice and to not to post angry and we’ll get through this. </p>
<p>Thanks again to special guest George Weidman of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWqr2tH3dPshNhPjV5h1xRw">SuperBunnyHop</a> for joining in.</p>

<p>Hosts: <a href="http://farcry.wikia.com/wiki/Pagan_Min">Josh</a>, <a href="http://www.chocolatehammer.org/">Rutskarn</a>, <a href="http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/">Chris</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/bunnyhopshow" title="SuperBunnyHop on YouTube">George Weidman (SuperBunnyHop)</a>, and <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale">Shamus</a>.</p>
<p>Show notes:<span id="more-25287"></span><br>
<strong>2:00 George and Chris have been playing Far Cry 4 together.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4:00 The Game Awards 2014.</strong></p>
<p>You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlLvCLP2h84">the entire show on YouTube</a>. The whole “Dorito” joke is a reference to <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/doritosgate">Doritogate</a>. We joke, but the whole story is pretty sad. The journalist who criticized it wound up being fired, and the guy who participated (Geoff Keighley) went on to greater things and eventually hosted this awards show. I don’t think Keighley is a villain by any stretch, but he is kind of the poster boy for capitulating, malleable journalism in the face of overbearing publisher PR control. </p>
<p><strong>20:00 Grand Theft Auto V pulled from the shelves of Target in Australia.</strong></p>
<p>I have no idea what happened to this conversation. We became so sarcastic we wrapped all the way around and started arguing our sarcastic points in earnest. Or something?</p>
<p>I can only speak for myself, but I think my position is: GTA V is no worse in content than dozens of other things you can buy at Target and its removal is nothing more than shrill voices getting their way. On the other hand, I’m having trouble marshaling my outrage because the game is so obnoxious and sanctimonious towards the American culture that makes its success possible. The game is greeted with both fawning adulation and outraged calls for censorship, and I don’t think it deserves either. </p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: Haven’t played V yet because they’re dragging their feet on a PC release. This opinion is based on my impressions of IV, and of the bits of the game I’ve seen so far. I’ll find out first-hand when they finally get around to the PC release next month.</em></p>
<p><strong>35:00 MAILTIME!</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Why do so many games that let you be a bad guy never let you be THE bad guy? Like in Overlord, you’re always opposed by people who are worse than you somehow. Never better than you. Do people just want to DO bad, no BE bad?</p>
<p>Yours,<br>
Ira</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast!</p>
<p>With all the Dragon Age talk you guys have recently, I wonder if you’ve heard the news: the game has DRM that hasn’t been cracked, so far. This so called Denuvo DRM is also in FIFA 15 which has been out for 2 months, and also hasn’t been cracked.<br>
There has been rumors about it causing technical problems, but the worst they can really seem to pin on it is a few percent performance decrease. Any opinions? If they’ve finally made an uncrackable DRM, is that good or bad?</p>
<p>Your biggest fan,<br>
Csirke
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast,</p>
<p>Shadows of Mordor has been criticized, including by Shamus, for completely contradicting much of the defining characteristics, central message, and tone of Tolkien’s work.</p>
<p>Has playing it given you any sympathy to people who object to the bait-and-switch they faced when playing Spec Ops: The Line? Would you have been able to appreciate the artistic statement if Shadows of Mordor had just been well-executed enough that it seemed to be saying Tolkien was wrong deliberately, yet still marketed itself as a straight Lord of the Rings game?</p>

      <itunes:summary>Trigger warning: In this episode we talk about mass murder, censorship, and social justice. These are touchy subjects. Just remember to be nice and to not to post angry and we’ll get through this. 

Thanks again to special guest George Weidman of SuperBunnyHop for joining in.


Hosts: Josh, Rutskarn, Chris, George Weidman (SuperBunnyHop), and Shamus.

Show notes:
2:00 George and Chris have been playing Far Cry 4 together.

4:00 The Game Awards 2014.

You can watch the entire show on YouTube. The whole “Dorito” joke is a reference to Doritogate. We joke, but the whole story is pretty sad. The journalist who criticized it wound up being fired, and the guy who participated (Geoff Keighley) went on to greater things and eventually hosted this awards show. I don’t think Keighley is a villain by any stretch, but he is kind of the poster boy for capitulating, malleable journalism in the face of overbearing publisher PR control. 

20:00 Grand Theft Auto V pulled from the shelves of Target in Australia.

I have no idea what happened to this conversation. We became so sarcastic we wrapped all the way around and started arguing our sarcastic points in earnest. Or something?

I can only speak for myself, but I think my position is: GTA V is no worse in content than dozens of other things you can buy at Target and its removal is nothing more than shrill voices getting their way. On the other hand, I’m having trouble marshaling my outrage because the game is so obnoxious and sanctimonious towards the American culture that makes its success possible. The game is greeted with both fawning adulation and outraged calls for censorship, and I don’t think it deserves either. 

Disclaimer: Haven’t played V yet because they’re dragging their feet on a PC release. This opinion is based on my impressions of IV, and of the bits of the game I’ve seen so far. I’ll find out first-hand when they finally get around to the PC release next month.

35:00 MAILTIME!

Dear Diecast,
Why do so many games that let you be a bad guy never let you be THE bad guy? Like in Overlord, you’re always opposed by people who are worse than you somehow. Never better than you. Do people just want to DO bad, no BE bad?
Yours,
Ira
Dear Diecast!
With all the Dragon Age talk you guys have recently, I wonder if you’ve heard the news: the game has DRM that hasn’t been cracked, so far. This so called Denuvo DRM is also in FIFA 15 which has been out for 2 months, and also hasn’t been cracked.
There has been rumors about it causing technical problems, but the worst they can really seem to pin on it is a few percent performance decrease. Any opinions? If they’ve finally made an uncrackable DRM, is that good or bad?
Your biggest fan,
Csirke

Dear Diecast,
Shadows of Mordor has been criticized, including by Shamus, for completely contradicting much of the defining characteristics, central message, and tone of Tolkien’s work.
Has playing it given you any sympathy to people who object to the bait-and-switch they faced when playing Spec Ops: The Line? Would you have been able to appreciate the artistic statement if Shadows of Mordor had just been well-executed enough that it seemed to be saying Tolkien was wrong deliberately, yet still marketed itself as a straight Lord of the Rings game?

Dear Diecast,
Josh: What is your favorite type of tea?
Shamus: What is your favorite alcoholic drink?
Everyone else: Answer whichever you want.

My question is, do you think writers should try to make more of an effort to account for the fact that players might not like a companion character, and let players do things like throw a companion out of the party – especially when they do controversial things like in this example – instead of seemingly writing characters under the assumption that players will love them?

Dear Diecast.

I was rewatching your Mass Effect-Spoiler Warning seasons recently, and one thing Shamus brought up during Mass Effect 1 was wanting to court-martial Ashley for killing Wrex, and throw her out of the party. My question is, do you think writers should try to make more of an effort to account for the fact that players might not like a companion character, and let players do things like throw a companion out of the party – especially when they do controversial things like in this example – instead of seemingly writing characters under the assumption that players will love them?

43:00 Surprise email, introduced mid-topic!

Dear Diecast,
Hi everyone! Did you know Ruts streamed the second half of the last Diecast (recorded 23/11/2014), and I got to listen to it live?
For an actual question, How do you feel about twists in game design, and especially games that outright reveal the twist, but keep it hidden only through the protagonist denying it?
All the best, keep diecasting,
Merzendi.
From here we go on to talk about the dangers of accidental livestreaming. This is a problem just waiting to make headlines.

46:30 And now back to the planned list of mailbag questions…

Die Dearcast,
Is there a foreseeable way put of the “everything is a franchise” mindset in the more expensive echelons of game development? If so, or if not, where do you think it might come from?
Yours,
Ira.
P.S.: Mr. Viel, what is a good entry point into the Shin Megami Tensei series? I’ve loved it from afar for a few years, but don’t know how or where to get involved.

        <![CDATA[<p>For the last two weeks I’ve had horrible internet connections during our recording sessions. Egregious throttling, lag spikes, etc. Very frustrating. This has made dialog even more problematic than usual. I’ve tried to clean up the interruptions and overlap as much as possible, but there’s only so much you can do in post. Please be patient.</p>

<p><span id="more-24859"></span><strong>1:00 Chris is hosting!</strong></p>
<p>This is a running gag every week, where Josh tries to get Chris to host. These crazy kids and their shenanigans.</p>
<p><strong>2:00 Let’s talk about re-releases!</strong></p>
<p>In my talk on re-compiling games I was trying to think and talk at the same time, which is never a good sign. Having digested the topic a bit more, I’ll refine my points on C vs. C++ thus:  C is easier to read, easier to follow, and easier to debug, but <strong>only if your code is sufficiently small</strong>. My problems with C enter in as the codebase grows in complexity.

      <itunes:summary>For the last two weeks I’ve had horrible internet connections during our recording sessions. Egregious throttling, lag spikes, etc. Very frustrating. This has made dialog even more problematic than usual. I’ve tried to clean up the interruptions and overlap as much as possible, but there’s only so much you can do in post. Please be patient.


Hosts: Chris, Josh,  Shamus, and Rutskarn.

Show notes:

1:00 Chris is hosting!

This is a running gag every week, where Josh tries to get Chris to host. These crazy kids and their shenanigans.

2:00 Let’s talk about re-releases!

In my talk on re-compiling games I was trying to think and talk at the same time, which is never a good sign. Having digested the topic a bit more, I’ll refine my points on C vs. C++ thus:  C is easier to read, easier to follow, and easier to debug, but only if your code is sufficiently small. My problems with C enter in as the codebase grows in complexity. The proliferation of side-effects and the lack of overarching structure eventually makes the project harder to understand than a comparable C++ project. (Note that some of this is stylistic and not mandated by the language itself.)

This is by no means a definitive statement on either language, but my view on how the two languages apply to the world of games. If you’re taking databases or operating systems, then I have no idea which is best or how they scale. 

23:00 Far Cry 4 dev says 1080p debate is a “weird echo chamber”

The fact that this would come from someone using the Cry engine – the poster child for the juvenile graphics-over-gameplay mentality – this comes off not just as dumb but as shockingly hypocritical. It’s like the team behind Games for Windows Live complaining that it’s a pain in the ass to need to log into Steam to play your game. 

35:00 Rutskarn is here and suddenly we’re talking about 7th guest.

Here is the Pushing Up Roses video I mentioned in the show, which gives a pretty good look at Night Trap and the controversy that surrounds it:




I will say that it’s really offensive to me that people complained about the nudity and violence the game didn’t have. Especially when they could have spent that time complaining about how bad it obviously sucked. Even the tiny clips are hard to watch.

<p>For the record, I LOVE the idea of a fantasy world where you can’t tell if magic, or gods, or perhaps one of many gods is real or not.

Advisers can come to you with stories, “The worshipers of Molag Butts have great harvests and are unbeatable in battle!” Maybe Molag Butts is real and favoring his people.

<blockquote><p>Ruts’s friend BlackFox here–I’ve been going through old Diecasts and noticed that you’ve been linking Josh’s name to such things as:<br>
the wiki page for Teddy Roosevelt<br>
the wiki page for Grigori Rasputin<br>
the wiki page for Machiavelli<br>
the wiki page for Troll (bridge variety)<br>
the wiki page for Troll (internet variety)<br>
the wiki page for Macedonian, which you all had an argument over how to pronounce in that Diecast<br>
various other wiki pages intended to be indicative of Josh’s grouchiness<br>
the Guild Wars 2 wiki page for the weapon called Incinerator<br>
a recent Spoiler Warning<br>
whiskey<br>
This is all highly amusing. So the actual question: Has anyone else actually noticed this? Rutskarn and Jarenth had not.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We didn’t actually answer this on the show, so for the record: For the first few dozen episodes, when I linked to Josh’s name in the hosts list I’d link to a different random thing every time. I stopped doing it because nobody noticed. But now I guess someone noticed.</p>

Dear Diecast,
Back in Diecast #2, drawn by Zach Snyder and written by Frank Quitely, the Diecasters made several humorous japes about possible future games based on the abused Aliens franchise.
One of them, Rutskarn’s “Hiding-based stealth game”, has(sorta) come true in the form of Alien: Isolation.
Judging by what I’ve seen and read, it doesn’t look like it’ll make up monetarily for Colonial Marines, or encourage future efforts like it. What are the odds that Sega will go back to small-hearted manshoots?
28:00

Dear Diecast team,
you probably know that Steam recently introduced Steam Curators, alongside the general store front overhaul. What do you think about it, and could you imagine acting as such a Curator yourselves? Maybe under the “Spoiler Warning” label, or as a “Twentysided Curator” or similar?
Best regards,
Niko

Dear Diecast, Thanks for all the work you guys do. Spoiler Warning and the Diecast make late nights in the lab much more enjoyable. A few questions for you:
-How do you pick which Kevin Macleod song you will use for the ending credits of spoiler warning?
-Are there any games from the spoiler warning seasons that you regret picking? How about the specials? (Trainz!)

Ruts’s friend BlackFox here–I’ve been going through old Diecasts and noticed that you’ve been linking Josh’s name to such things as:
the wiki page for Teddy Roosevelt
the wiki page for Grigori Rasputin
the wiki page for Machiavelli
the wiki page for Troll (bridge variety)
the wiki page for Troll (internet variety)
the wiki page for Macedonian, which you all had an argument over how to pronounce in that Diecast
various other wiki pages intended to be indicative of Josh’s grouchiness
the Guild Wars 2 wiki page for the weapon called Incinerator
a recent Spoiler Warning
whiskey
This is all highly amusing. So the actual question: Has anyone else actually noticed this? Rutskarn and Jarenth had not.

We didn’t actually answer this on the show, so for the record: For the first few dozen episodes, when I linked to Josh’s name in the hosts list I’d link to a different random thing every time. I stopped doing it because nobody noticed. But now I guess someone noticed.

      <itunes:summary>The plan this week was to talk about the canceled Blizzard MMO and a few other current topics. Instead we talked about a sixteen-year-old hack-n-slash. I don’t know. That’s how this show goes sometimes.

And yes, I’m still fiddling with the theme music. Based on the feedback last week, most people would prefer if I just went back to the original theme that we used for 70 episodes. I might. But allow me this little vanity for now. It’s short and I’m having fun with it.


Hosts: Jarenth, Josh,  Shamus, and Rutskarn.

Show notes:

2:00 Shamus is playing Diablo 2.

Here is the video I mentioned: Ideas about a new programming language for games.

19:00 Josh is playing Final Fantasy 13.

Warning: I’m pretty sure Josh spoils the plot of the game in this segment. I can’t tell for sure because I had slammed my hands over my ears, groaning uncontrollably after the first hour of his description.  

35:00 Jarenth is playing Concursion and Crypt of the NecroDancer.

Here is his review on Concursion.

But somehow we end up talking about leaderboad games. This is the game I was talking about. I like it a bunch. Just remember: Don’t tell Chris.

45:00 Rutskarn is playing Payday 2 and Far Cry 2.

But instead of talking about those he tells us some tabletop gaming stories, which are a lot more interesting.

        <![CDATA[<p>Experiment: This week I shifted the participants a little to the left or right speakers. My hope is that this can help untangle cross-talk when it happens. Usually one person just overpowers another, and if you want to hear the person who got drowned out, you’re out of luck.</p>
<p>I actually edit the audio to fix as much cross-talk as I can.  If (during recording) I charge in saying, “You know what? I think that-” and then I shut up because I realize I’m overlapping with someone else, then during editing I’ll just mute that phrase so the other person can be heard more clearly. Basically, when two people talk at once, I’ll mute the one who retreated. But there are still instances of overlapping that just can’t be helped.  Maybe this stereo separation will help, or maybe it will just be annoying and distracting. </p>

18:00 Shamus is playing Sunless Sea.

Sunless Sea is by the people who brought us Echo Bazaar / Fallen London.

23:00 Mumbles is playing Wind Waker.

25:00 Mumbles is also playing TF2 beta maps.

28:30 Mumbles has watched the Gotham Extended trailer.

39:00 Chris is playing Five Nights at Freddy’s.

We went a little off-topic before going WAY off topic, before coming back around and losing our way completely. Here is the Loading Ready Run skit that I mentioned. (My favorite.)

I answered this in part on the show, but I’m going to answer it more fully in tomorrow’s column.

25:00 Twitch TV has rolled out a dumb broken ContentID system.

Like I said the other day:




38:30 Sims 4 is missing a lot of features.

It didn’t sound like a big deal to me at first, but it all sounds kind of shocking when you actually read the list. It’s even more worrisome when you remember what happened to SimCity. Is EA going to ruin two major Maxis titles with their meddling? I’m perversely anxious to find out.

Dear Diecast,
Spoiler Warning has Reginald Cuftbert as a recurring character in every new game. Do any members of the cast have their own special character that makes a return in the various games that you play?

<p>I think the reason Josh questioned the authenticity of the above question is that we had just been talking about this before the show, and it seemed kind of convenient to have an email pop up on the same topic. </p>
<p>With regard to how we record audio: I know we discuss this every six months or so, but the topic keeps coming up and I don’t know what else to do. It really <strong>seems</strong> like it should be super-easy to solve, so we get lots of helpful suggestions like, “I don’t see why you guys can’t just [impractical thing].” Explaining why the obvious solutions don’t work ends up being this fifteen minute enumeration of drawbacks and trade-offs. Sorry if this gets tedious. </p>
<p>Another thing that I’m realizing now is that we actually have different audio needs. The audio of Spoiler Warning is fine if it’s a little crappy. There’s game noise and music and shouting and it’s not expected to be high quality. Lots of internet shows have wretched audio and do just fine. But in podcasts, audio IS the content and some people have very very good audio setups. <a href="http://www.feartheboot.com/ftb/">Some shows</a> have high-end mics and compressors and all the hosts gather in the same room so latency isn’t a problem. They can get pro-quality audio. Our hosts have thousands of miles between us, and some of us are on sub-optimal machines, in noisy houses, with spotty internet.</p>
<p>I actually fuss with the audio of the Diecast quite a bit. If three people talk at once, sometimes I can mute or time-shift people to clear up the collisions, and I do what I can to even out the volume levels and make the show slightly less aurally unpleasant. (Chris has an electric hum sometimes. Rutskarn sometimes has ambient room noise like dogs barking or people talking. I have a ton of fans around me, flooding my recordings with white noise. Mumbles has really intense volume variations, from quiet whispers to explosive shouts. Josh’s hands-free setup results in occasional bits of background noise or sniffling that need to be silenced. And EVERYONE has different volume levels every week.)   </p>
<p>So yeah. It’s harder than it seems. </p>
<blockquote><p>I’m curious since you have actual professional experience with 3D internet what your thoughts are on VR internet. For Diecast or Blog or even just reply to me. </p>
<p>It started to sound like a stupid question to me as I was typing because we’re probably going to have MMO VR right? But then lag would probably be a big issue and MMOs are proprietary single owner platforms.</p>
<p>I guess there’s a question in there. I don’t need an answer, I’d just like to hear or see you pontificate on this. </p>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>This episode is a continuation of the same session as the previous Diecast. A side note about the recording of this episode is that – time zones being what they are – the sun was coming up for Jarenth when we finished recording this show, and at the same time it had only recently gone down for Josh. This might also explain why Jarenth isn’t as chatty as you were hoping. </p>
<p>Again, thanks for staying up so late to make these episodes happen. </p>

<p>Hosts: <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/trollface-coolface-problem">Josh</a>, <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale">Shamus</a>, <a href="http://www.ninja-blues.com/">Jarenth</a>, and <a href="http://krellen.net/">Krellen</a>.</p>
<p>Show Notes:<br>
<span id="more-23858"></span></p>
<p><strong>0:30 Shamus is playing Bulletstorm.</strong></p>
<p>Due to poor planning on my part, <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=23810" title="Bulletstorm: Lowbrow, Loud, Juvenile, and Proud">my full review of Bulletstorm</a> already appeared earlier this week. So now you get the more rambling, less organized, I-haven’t-finished-it-yet version. </p>
<p><strong>6:00 Krellen has played Unrest.</strong></p>
<p>This section is spoiler-free.</p>
<p><strong>7:00 Krellen is also playing Saints Row IV Co-op.</strong></p>
<p><strong>10:30 Krellen played through System Shock 2 for the first time ever last week.</strong></p>
<p><strong>27:00 Jarenth has been playing <a href="http://forever-entertainment.com/fryderyk/">Frederic – Resurrection of Music</a>.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ninja-blues.com/2014/07/28/indie-wonderland-frederic-resurrection-music/">Here is his writeup over on Ninja Blues</a>.</p>
<p><strong>33:30 Jarenth is also playing Magic 2015.</strong></p>
<p><strong>35:00 MAILTIME!</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Diecast,</p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed, Mass Effect and Too Human were all reported to be trilogies and long term franchises during their respective pre- and post- release press hype. Ironically, the games also were announced/released around the same time. How do you all feel about Too Human suffering the best fate?</p>
<p>Thanks for the podcast/show,<br>
Steven</p></blockquote>

      <itunes:summary>This episode is a continuation of the same session as the previous Diecast. A side note about the recording of this episode is that – time zones being what they are – the sun was coming up for Jarenth when we finished recording this show, and at the same time it had only recently gone down for Josh. This might also explain why Jarenth isn’t as chatty as you were hoping. 

Again, thanks for staying up so late to make these episodes happen. 


Hosts: Josh, Shamus, Jarenth, and Krellen.

Show Notes:


0:30 Shamus is playing Bulletstorm.

Due to poor planning on my part, my full review of Bulletstorm already appeared earlier this week. So now you get the more rambling, less organized, I-haven’t-finished-it-yet version. 

6:00 Krellen has played Unrest.

This section is spoiler-free.

7:00 Krellen is also playing Saints Row IV Co-op.

10:30 Krellen played through System Shock 2 for the first time ever last week.

27:00 Jarenth has been playing Frederic – Resurrection of Music.

Here is his writeup over on Ninja Blues.

33:30 Jarenth is also playing Magic 2015.

35:00 MAILTIME!

Diecast,
Assassin’s Creed, Mass Effect and Too Human were all reported to be trilogies and long term franchises during their respective pre- and post- release press hype. Ironically, the games also were announced/released around the same time. How do you all feel about Too Human suffering the best fate?
Thanks for the podcast/show,
Steven
What do each of you think is the most prevalent problem affecting stories of games?

<p><strong>11:00 Crytek’s <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2014/7/27/5941815/crytek-rumor-homefront-statement">ongoing financial problems</a>.</strong></p>
<p>We glossed over a point that I wanted to talk about in more detail: As Jarenth said, Crytek is known for making “really pretty” games. Or game engines. But we’re so far past the point of diminishing returns that their skills are basically moot. Think of it this way: Imagine the programmers at Crytek could suddenly make all their graphics run 50% faster. You can just hand-wave it and say a wizard makes it so that when running Cry Engine games, graphics cards have 50% more power.</p>
<p>I maintain that this benefit – even though it’s a complete miracle – would be of very limited business value. Homefront flopped, and that had nothing to do with its graphics. (In fact, I’m pretty sure the graphics were the only thing they got right. Which makes it even more mysterious as to why CryTek would bother with it.) When was the last time a game really sold on the basis of its graphics alone? AAA graphics are like pizza and sex: Even when they’re way below average, they’re still pretty great. </p>
<p><strong>27:00 The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/winterkewlgames/yogventures/posts">Yogventures Kickstarter</a> did not <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/07/17/yogscast-cancel-kickstarter-backed-yogventures-say-its-failure-is-a-deep-regret/">end well</a>.</strong></p>
<p>And here is the related mailbag question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast</p>

<p>The Yogventures story is so sad. Half a million bucks, and very little to show for it other than a lot of rumors and finger-pointing.

<strong>00:30 Intro, wherein Campster makes a joke about fedoras.</strong></p>
<p>For the record: I joined in on the joke, but I actually think the fedora is a fine hat when worn in the right context. It’s gotten a bad reputation online from some people attempting to build their persona / establish a character around a simple hat, and it’s been rightfully maligned because some people insist on wearing them with otherwise casual clothing. A fedora is a “dress up” hat, not a “dress down” hat, and wearing it casually is like pairing a bowtie with an <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ed+Hardy+shirt&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS518US518&amp;es_sm=122&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZE7MU6OHB9agyAS214GwDw&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1192&amp;bih=760&amp;dpr=1.5">Ed Hardy shirt</a>. (PROTIP: <strong>DO NOT.</strong>)</p>
<p>But if you don a fedora with proper slacks, a dress shirt, and a vest? Ignore the haters. That shit is <em>dapper</em>.</p>

<p></p><p></p>
<p><strong>19:00 We talk about food for no reason.</strong></p>
<p>I feel like a failure as a host. When Josh started talking about how the appendix was a vestigial organ, I was kind of torn. Do I let him know that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermiform_appendix#Maintaining_gut_flora">appendix has actually been found to have a purpose</a>, thus dragging us even further off-topic? Or do I let him go, thus increasing the number and intensity of the corrections in the comments? Maybe I made the wrong call. I guess we’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>21:00 Back to Unrest.</strong></p>

I have heard Shamus say several times that YouTube ContentID can identify cutscenes but cannot identify gameplay.<br>
I understand that you do not have inside knowledge of Content ID, but do you as a gamer/programmer see any issue with IDing a game by its UI/HUD? It is distinctive for every game (or franchise) and it is always in the same place on screen.<br>

Hi,

I understand that you do not have inside knowledge of Content ID, but do you as a gamer/programmer see any issue with IDing a game by its UI/HUD? It is distinctive for every game (or franchise) and it is always in the same place on screen.

      <itunes:summary>Just before this episode went live, Josh sent me a link to this, which is probably the most unsuitably high-quality image of Reginald Cuftburt ever produced. It’s like seeing a classical marble bust of Spongebob. Anyway, share it on Facebook or GeoCities or Angelfire. Or Tumbl it. Or Twit it. Whatever it is you young people do with data when you’re doing internet show-and-tell.


Hosts:
Josh, Shamus, Mumbles, and Campster.

Show notes:

1:00 Shamus is playing Retro/Grade and Girls Like Robots.

Here are my original thought on Girls Like Robots after PAX 2012.

3:30 Shamus watched THE LEGO MOVIE.

Warning: Lengthy Batman conversation ensues. Here’s the Batman song we discussed. We also talk about Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man.

18:00 Mumbles is playing Divinity: Original Sin.

28:00 Chris has been playing Payday 2.

33:00 Chris has also been playing Valiant Hearts.

The rest of us haven’t played it.  Here is what SuperBunnyHop has to say about it. 

37:00 Chris has also been playing Dead Rising 3.

Wait, Dead Island 2 is being made by Yeager, the team behind Spec Ops: The Line? I have no idea how I feel about that. It’s either brilliant or idiotic. 

46:00 Chis also got the Super Ultra Dead Rising 3′ Arcade Remix Hyper Edition EX + Î±.

That title is the kind of thing I make up to make fun of games with overly elaborate titles. Capcom knows all my moves, so they countered me by making a double ridiculous title. What am I supposed to do now? Make a triple ridiculous name? Or maybe reverse it and call the game “Dave”? Nah. I know when I’m beat.

You win this time, Capcom.

50:00 The challenges of having a large Steam library, buying games for making content, using footage from other people, fair use, YouTube culture, and Net Neutrality.

This is a little bit insider-y, but it’s the kind of stuff we worry about when shopping for games and making content. 

Warning: Shamus becomes sad.

1:00:00 Mail time!

Dear Diecast,
What genres of music do guys enjoy and how well do you think they’ve been implemented in games?

<p>I’ll admit I’ve been totally unfair to Origin. They’re making modest, incremental progress into the market and as someone who has been publicly hounding them to change, I really ought to <strong>at least</strong> have the decency to check out their free games. </p>

<p>“Nameless Bob” is now my favorite character name. </p>
<p><strong>20:30 Shamus talks about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Typing_of_the_Dead">Typing of the Dead</a>.</strong></p>
<p>What you’ve heard here is true: I do not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing">touch-type</a>. That’s pretty ridiculous for someone who types for a living. It’s like a professional driver not knowing how to operate a manual transmission. At any rate, if you’re looking to learn to touch-type, Typing of the Dead is not a good place to start.</p>
<p>Note the 22 minute mark when I try to explain how long it’s been since I was 15 years old. Nothing will destroy your capacity to perform simple math like making calculations based on your own age. When the left half of your brain offers up the right answer, the right half of your brain will jump in with, “Ridiculous! It can’t possibly have been that long. It’s probably… half that. Yeah. Half-ish.” </p>
<p><strong>33:00 Shamus talks about <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seanyoung/magicite-a-multiplayer-rpg-platformer">Magicite</a>.</strong></p>
<p>As I’m doing this write-up, I’ve discovered that <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seanyoung/magicite-a-multiplayer-rpg-platformer">Magicite is a Kickstarted game</a>. I should also add that if you’ve got a background with 2D platformers (like if you grew up with the NES, as I’m sure is true of most of the target audience of this game) your experience will likely be very different than mine. If you’re competent with that type of gameplay then I do recommend giving this a look. It’s got tons of charm. </p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Here is an hour of four people talking about videogames. I don’t know why you like this sort of thing, but it’s not my place to judge. </p>

<p>Show notes:<span id="more-23417"></span></p>
<p><strong>01:00 E3 Wrap-up.</strong></p>
<p>We say we don’t have anything left to say about E3, but then we talk about it for ten minutes. And since we brought up both Anthony Burch and panels, that gives me an excuse to link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm0rrGBin5Q">Dying is Funny, Comedy is Easy</a>, a presentation by Burch on why more games should embrace comedy.</p>
<p><strong>10:00 Watch_Dogs is a tone-deaf narrative with hackneyed characters.</strong></p>
<p>Chis and I talk about the game at length. Spoiler: It’s not our Game of the Year.</p>
<p><strong>19:00 Let’s talk about something else.</strong></p>
<p>Like the terrible Watch_Dogs gameplay.</p>
<p><strong>38:00 Somewhere along the line we lose the plot and talk about Ubisoft and Elder Scrolls.</strong></p>
<p>We didn’t even plan to discuss Elder Scrolls this week. It just happened. </p>
<p><strong>50:00 Steam Summer Sale!</strong></p>
<p>Actually, while we were going to talk about the sale for this segment, we just wound up talking about what we’re playing. Go figure.</p>
<p>Chris is playing <a href="http://amon26.itch.io/in-the-kingdom">In the Kingdom</a> and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/games/killer-instinct#fbid=B0Qlpcntr1O">Killer Instinct</a>.</p>
<p>I’m playing <a href="http://riskofraingame.com/">Risk of Rain</a>. Also <a href="http://www.puppygames.net/revenge-of-the-titans/">Revenge of the Titans</a> from <a href="http://www.puppygames.net/">Puppygames</a>. In this segment I said I had all the titles from Puppygames. Not so! They now have <a href="http://www.puppygames.net/droid-assault/">Droid Assault</a>, which is part of the Steam sale at the moment. So NOW I have all the Puppygames.</p>

We didn’t even plan to discuss Elder Scrolls this week. It just happened. 

50:00 Steam Summer Sale!

Actually, while we were going to talk about the sale for this segment, we just wound up talking about what we’re playing. Go figure.

Chris is playing In the Kingdom and Killer Instinct.

I’m playing Risk of Rain. Also Revenge of the Titans from Puppygames. In this segment I said I had all the titles from Puppygames. Not so! They now have Droid Assault, which is part of the Steam sale at the moment. So NOW I have all the Puppygames.

      <itunes:summary>The number one requested feature for the show is an RSS feed for the podcast that handles the audio tagging properly. I’ve never figured out how to do this in WordPress without importing ridiculous podcasting contraptions or crawling down into the guts of WordPress to do it myself. But! Someone has set one up for us. I don’t use RSS and I can’t comment on how compatible / reliable / useful / accurate it is. It’s hosted off-site and I don’t know anything about it other than:


It exists.
Seems to work for everyone who has tried it so far.

Thanks for putting that together.


Hosts:
Josh, Sham, Puns, Cannibal Wrestling, and Regret.

Show notes: 

01:00 Chris talks about a movie.

Apparently Do it Again, Stupid is now a movie?

4:00 Just kidding. That last section was just us arguing about groundhog(s) for no good reason. NOW we’re talking about Edge of Tomorrow.

Here’s a trailer, if you’re interested.

6:00 Chris played Among the Sleep.

Official site.

12:00 Rutskarn is playing The Walking Dead: Season 2.

This discussion is spoiler-free. 

20:00 Mumbles is upset about what happened to the Shield.

Not these guys. These guys.

29:30 Mumbles and Chris talk Mario Kart.

37:00 Shamus has Played Wolfenstein: The New Order.

My column (should go up on Tuesday) is about the game. The question of “Is this Jewish conspiracy offensive or not?” is likely to be a touchy one. This is a sensitive subject handled in a very broad-strokes game, and it’s probably not particularly useful to get enraged at people who feel too much or too little outrage relative to yours. Robert Rath had a column last week where he came down strongly on the “This is not okay” side of the argument. I didn’t like the idea when I heard it, but when I saw it in the game I was basically willing to go along with it.

58:00 Josh had an X-Man movie marathon!

We talk about the early X-Men movies, the latest X-Men movie, and the X-Men comics. This conversation was really confusing and hard for me to follow, but I think there are Days of Future Past spoilers in there. Maybe.

1:30 Chris talks about Wolfenstein: The New Order

Here are the Polygon articles Chris mentioned: 

Wolfenstein is the rare game that shows sex as both fun and healing

Wolfenstein: The New Order shows you the horror of concentration camps from the first-person.

16:00 Shamus had a fight with Google. 

The post is down until I get this sorted out, although you can see the original text here. You can decide for yourself if that qualifies as outrageous adult content. For contrast, here is the Call of Roma ad that was repeatedly deemed okay by Google under the same standards. Which means Google was regularly putting stuff on my site that was – by any reasonable measure – far more offensive than what they banned me for. And in both cases I was denied any way to tell them their system was malfunctioning.

Running a Patreon campaign is a big deal for me. It’s going to take me a little while to set it up. I’ll talk more about this once I figure out what I’m doing.

28:00 A digression on various obnoxious / annoying / “evil” internet companies, from Google to Amazon.

This is what made me dislike Amazon, and question if our patent system does objectively more damage than good in the world.

39:00 Mumbles talks about Bombshell and female characters created by female designers.

49:00 Shamus and Mumble hijack things and talk comics for a bit.

We talk about Punisher, Dr. Strange, and The Superior Foes of Spider-Man. Tragically, TSFoSM isn’t yet available on Marvel Unlimited. At least, I think it isn’t. Their search functionality and catalog indexing is atrocious. 

EDIT: I found it. Their own search engine was useless. Google took me right to it.

54:00 Chris and Josh talk about Transistor.

<p><strong>0:30 Josh is playing Dark Souls 2. Still!</strong></p>

22:00 Shamus has been been reading Marvel Comics!

Unrest is not available for pre-order on Steam, but it has a Steam page anyway. So that’s cool. Also, Chocolate Hammer might be revived soon. Cross your fingers.

55:00 Rutskarn shares some of the experimental tabletop games he’s been playing.

<p>…until it all turned green and fell off. But I’m nearly back to normal now. In the meantime, the kids did the show without me. I’m listening to the show for the first time as I write this, so we’re going to experience this together. </p>
<p>Let’s do this:</p>

<p>Hosts: <a href="http://www.jamesonwhiskey.com/us/agegate">Josh</a>, <a href="http://www.chocolatehammer.org/">Rutskarn</a>, <a href="http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/">Chris</a>, and <a href="http://digitalmumbles.com/">Mumbles</a>.</p>

<p><span id="more-22938"></span><strong>2:00 Chris has entered the strange world of mobile gaming. He’s playing <a href="http://www.gameloft.com/mobile-games/jurassic-park/">Jurassic Park</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Really? The game is just called “Jurassic Park”? Not “Jurassic Park: Mobile” or “Jurassic Park: Reviving Previously Extinct Species to have them Fight to the Death in a sick and Decadent Pit-Fight in the Name of Animal Cruelty Because Obviously”? Nothing to distinguish it from the movie, or the hundreds of other games that have also failed to do justice to the Jurassic Park mythos? No?</p>
<p>Okay then.</p>
<p><strong>9:00 Chris is playing <a href="http://rustysrealdealbaseball.nintendo.com/">Rusty’s Real Deal Baseball</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>18:30 Mumbles has been learning The Console Gaming.</strong>  </p>
<p>Specifically, she’s been playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Defense_Force_2017">Earth Defense Force 2017</a>. After that she’s going to play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asura's_Wrath">Asura’s Wrath</a>, which I gather is a videogame of some sort.</p>
<p><strong>29:00 Apparently we digressed into Hearthstone at some point? That’s the new card game thing, right?</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>32:00 Josh is playing Dark Souls 2 and <a href="http://www.strongholdkingdoms.com/">Stronghold Kingdoms</a>.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>40:00 Rutskarn is playing Planescape Torment.</strong></p>
<p>For the record: Yes, I played through Planescape Torment. You lightweights.</p>
<p><strong>48:00 The Star Wars Extended Universe is not recognized as canon by Disney.</strong></p>
<p>I am not surprised by this. J.J. Abrams rebooted ALL OF STAR TREK, and I suspect it was partly because he didn’t want to have to do a hundred hours of research every time someone pushed a button in the movie. He’s not my first choice for either franchise, and he’s never going to give us a <em>Wrath of Khan</em> or an <em>Empire Strikes Back</em>. But in my book he’s like Michael Bay except he knows to to make a movie. It might be cheap, disposable entertainment, but at least it holds together as a cohesive story with proper character beats. And I’ll take ridiculous LENS FLARE over incomprehensible, puke-inducing shaky-cam any day.</p>
<p>Hang on. After I typed that last paragraph I remembered that Abrams just made Star Trek Into Darkness, and it <em>did</em> try to re-create Wrath of Khan, and it <em>wasn’t</em> a cohesive story at all. I haven’t watched it, but that’s what I heard, anyway. Did I just bolster my position before destroying it? I don’t know. I report. You deride. </p>
<p>ANYWAY.</p>
<p>This might be for the best. Abrams strikes me as not the best person to manage the intersection of dozens of films and books. He’s not a detail guy, and he would probably just infuriate fans if he actually tried to build on existing extended universe canon. It’s far better for him to be up front and honest about what he’s doing so we can go in with our expectations properly calibrated. </p>
<p><strong>1:00:00 Shouldn’t the show be about over by now? Are we still talking about Star Wars? </strong></p>

How do you feel about the use of radiant quests in Skyrim? Where do you see the potential of randomly generated quests for other games or in the future?
P.S.: I don’t like Skyrim’s radiant quests but I think the system has a lot of potential.

Dear Diecast,
The Unreal Engine 4 launched recently, with a very interesting pricing model. A flat monthly subscription fee and 5% off the top is an amazing direction to go in compared to their previous pricing models and removes the barrier to entry for indie developers. Do you think we’ll see a huge surge of indies using the engine? Are you tempted to try it out yourself? I know I am.

What do you think of the recent announcement that the in-development World of Darkness MMO has been canceled?  Is this a tragic loss, or have they just avoided a situation like Elder Scrolls Online where an MMO launches and fails to meet expectations from the fans?
Dave B.
28:00

Dear Strongbad,
What is your least favorite game in Spoiler Warning?
With crap,
Rutskarn
44:00 Romance characters in games.

We end with Rutskarn beginning a tale of his very first D&amp;D game. That story will lead off our next Diecast. See you later this week.

<p><strong>32:00 Who is Dennis Hopper?</strong></p>
<p>We often feign outrage for comedic effect, but I was actually stunned silent when the guys described <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000454/">DENNIS HOPPER</a> as “the guy who played King Koopa”.

<p>Show notes:<span id="more-22813"></span></p>
<p><strong>1:20 Josh is playing FTL: Advanced Edition.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=17335" title="FTL: Random vs. Skill">My write-up on FTL is here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>8:00 Chris is playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbheiGx0-A">Disney Magical World</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>13:00 Chris is also playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qsdIveYJ0Y">Actual Sunlight</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Interesting that this is the <a href="http://www.depressionquest.com/">second</a> game about depression I’ve run into in the last few months.</p>
<p>Personal talk:</p>
<p>I’ve had days where I woke up and found I couldn’t feel joy or happiness or even contentment. Where nothing felt worth doing. The usual fire I had to consume and talk about games (or do anything else) was just… <em>gone</em>. There was never any reason for this. Everything was fine in my life, aside from the fact that my mood was unaccountably mis-calibrated. I don’t know that this is anything like the clinical depression that some people talk about, but I use it as a frame of reference. My episodes always blow over after a few days and don’t linger for weeks or months on end. </p>
<p>Regardless of whether this is depression or not, it’s certainly an interesting phenomena. We tend to assume that our moods are linked to our situations, and it can be completely baffling and frustrating when that connection is broken. <em>I have no reason to be sad right now. So why am I sad?</em></p>
<p>Having never played either game myself, I do wonder what the intent behind them is. Are they a way for people suffering from depression to feel some sort of connection with each other? Is this a way of saying “You are not alone” to others? Or is this intended to share the experience with people who have never been through it and don’t understand what it’s like?</p>
<p>I wish I’d asked Chris during the show, but I’d love to hear from anyone who has played either game.</p>
<p><strong>15:00 Shamus is working on programming. But not Good Robot.</strong></p>
<p>Stuff I’m working on / thinking about:</p>
<p>1) GLSL shading language. 2) Systems which are incredibly robust with regards to consistency of framerate. 3) Different techniques for offloading CPU work onto the graphics card.</p>
<p>Maybe we’ll talk about this later in the week. Maybe not. I still need to finish my write-up on Thief.</p>
<p><strong>16:00 <a href="http://www.civilization.com/#trailer">Civilization: Beyond Earth</a> has been announced. So we spend a bunch of time talking about Alpha Centauri.</strong></p>
<p>This topic gets derailed by religion in games. If you want to skip that, jump ahead to somewhere around the 37 minute mark.</p>
<p><strong>26:00 Surprise mid-podcast mailbag!</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>What do you think about religion in video games as a mechanic and why is Christianity not as explored as Greek and North mythology?</p>
<p>-Adrian</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>34:00 We talk about Jade Empire.</strong></p>
<p><strong>37:00 And back to Civilization.</strong></p>
<p><strong>44:00 Mailbag!</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Diecast/Shamus</p>

Dear Diecast/Shamus
So we’re familiar with your stance on graphics resources.  After reading your recent article on the Oculus Rift, do you think the “graphics arms race” is (truly) relevant again in the games industry because of VR?
~Ian
Amazing question. I’d already been thinking about this it for a while when the question showed up, so I had a lot to say about it.

Dear Diecast,
Do you find international perspectives on games to be interesting? For example, is Diecast irregular Jarenth valuable for his Dutch-ness as well as his Jarenth-ness?
Cheers,
Neil from England
Let me plug Jarenth here while I have an excuse.

Show notes:

1:00 Christopher is playing Goat Simulator

Here is the Goat Simulator trailer, which is a send-up of the infamous Dead Island trailer. And I’m pretty sure this is the Farming Simulator Joke Jarenth was taking about.

8:00 Joshua is still playing Dark Souls.

17:00 Joshua also played BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea DLC. Both of them. Together.

31:00 Dr. Jarenth has been playing Netrunner.

Here is the Leigh Alexander piece on Netrunner, which is what got both Chris and Jarenth interested in it. Also, he’s been playing a bit of Creeper World 3.

35:00 Shamus is playing Terraria.

38:00 Shamus and Josh talk about Archer.

Here is the Archer YouTube channel, to give you an idea of what the show looks like. Note that in the latest season they’ve abandoned the spy motif for a Miami Vice motif. Haven’t seen it yet myself. Netflix releases typically lag behind broadcast television.

42:00 MAILBAG!

After seeing the Machine for Pigs episode, I felt I should ask: What’s the most minimalistic game that you enjoyed enough to recommend? Conversely, what’s the most complex game that you can recall engrossing you?
-Rueben


Shamus chronicles his development adventures quite well for us, but what about the rest of you? Have you dabbled in game development at all and what did you think?
Even that stupid text adventure you wrote in high school could be fun to talk about.
-Taylor
This is my favorite question in ages. It turns out all of us have dabbled in game development. Also I talk a bit about the programming I’ve been doing lately. 

I’m sure this topic will come up in the show itself, but I figured I’d try to make sure of it.
What do you guys think about Facebook buying Occulus?  I mean, a global megacorporation that knows everything about everyone taking over the industry leader in virtual reality is basically the setup for almost every cyberpunk setting ever, right?

        <![CDATA[<p>This is it: The great Mailbag Reckoning. If you sent in a question before March 26<sup>th</sup> and it hasn’t been answered before, then it’s either answered today, or never. All questions are forever answered, or forever ignored. </p>

<p><strong>12:00 OOPS FEMINISM</strong></p>
<p>It’s hard to stop talking about this subject once you get started. For me the compelling thing is the completely anarchic and asymmetrical nature of the debate. This isn’t a two-sided war between people who want female protagonists and people who don’t. This is a multi-faceted debate where extremists tend to get the most attention. There are a lot of different types of “feminists” (who might not even self-identify as feminists<span class="snote" title="1">I don’t self-identify as one, but I’ve been called one. Labels are dangerous things and the LAST thing I want is another argument over what the word “feminist” means.</span>) who just want more female protagonists. Then there are angry people who think that sexy characters are inherently destructive and that enjoying some T&amp;A makes you a horrible person. Then the other side fails to draw a distinction between these two positions and hilarity ensues. Add in a handful of really ugly, Angry Young Men who spew hate and threats. Then have the feminist side<span class="snote" title="2">And remember, this side is actually several sides that don’t all self-identify as feminist.</span> paint all of the opposition as if they were in league with – and sympathetic to – the Angry Young Men. Add in a couple of layers of counter-backlash to either side and suddenly it’s really hard to understand how such a simple idea can generate so much outrage.</p>
<p>This complete mayhem creates a desire from people like me to clear up this confusion. Maybe I can’t settle the debate, but maybe I can at least help the various sides understand the complexity of the conflict? But no. My efforts never help and I just end up being yet another idealistic idiot shouting into the storm. And so it goes.</p>
<p>Rutskarn mentioned this post from <a href="http://susanarendt.com/2014/03/04/why-titanfalls-launch-trailer-made-me-emotional/">Susan Arendt on the Titanfall trailer</a>. </p>
<p>We also talk about women being integrated into the US Navy. This is such a sad topic for me. There are a lot more anecdotes like the one I told. The problem is that the whole subject is dripping with politics, and even people doing the right things are often doing them in the wrong way and for the wrong reasons. For reference, these events happened around 1991 through 1993. (My brother was in boot camp when the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailhook_scandal">Tailhook scandal</a> took place.) I don’t know how the Navy is doing these days, but the early days of co-ed service were a complete mess. I could fill several pages with stories about how completely dysfunctional the service was and about how ugly and unfair (to both genders) integration was. </p>

      <link>http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=22416</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Here is an entire episode dedicated to a single game. Thief [4] has been a long time coming. Some have been excited to see it return. Some hopeful. Some outraged. Some resigned. But now we’ve played it and we can see the result for ourselves. </p>
<p>It’s not the game we hoped for, but neither is it the train wreck we feared. </p>

<p>Hosts: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt">Josh</a>, <a href="http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/">Chris</a>, and <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale">Shamus</a>. </p>
<p>The entire show is about Thief, so no timestamps. We spoil some of the themes of the story during the show, but nothing that shouldn’t be incredibly obvious after the tutorial. </p>
<p>At the 57-minute mark we talk about the ending, so you might want to skip that part if you’re spoiler-averse.  Although as Chris says, the story is pretty much broken, and I don’t think spoilers will hurt you. And by “broken” I mean, “clearly a patchwork of different revisions of the story that don’t fit together or form a proper sequence of events”. </p>

<p><a href="http://candyswipe.com/king.html">Here is the statement from the creator of Candy Swipe</a>. The guy made Candy Swipe in 2010. The King.com made a rip-off of the game in 2012.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>This episode was recorded AFTER our <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?page_id=16386">Spoiler Warning</a> session this week, but it’s being released first. We were a little tired and a couple of hosts short by the time we got to this point. </p>

<p>Hosts: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelly_bean">Josh</a>, <a href="http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/">Chris</a>, and <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale">Shamus</a>.</p>
<p>Show notes:<span id="more-22170"></span></p>
<p><strong>1:00 Shamus is playing Elder Scrolls Online and EVE Online.</strong></p>
<p>We can’t talk about ESO yet. (Embargoed until Feburay 7th.) But we can talk about <a href="http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/the-bloodbath-of-b-r5rb/">the battle of B-R5RB</a>. Note that we had this conversation before I did the homework for <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=22139">my recent EVE post</a>.</p>
<p><strong>28:00 We move on from EVE and talk about space games more broadly.</strong></p>
<p>Like I said in the show, there are a lot of space games on the way. Check it out: <a href="https://blockaderunnergame.com/">Blockade Runner</a>, <a href="http://elite.frontier.co.uk/">Elite: Dangerous</a>, <a href="http://www.felixvast.com/">Felix Vast</a>, <a href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/">Kerbal Space Program</a>, <a href="http://badlandstudio.com/kinetic-void/">Kinetic Void</a>, <a href="http://ltheory.com/">Limit Theory</a>, <a href="http://www.mandategame.com/">The Mandate</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRpDn5qPp3s">No Man’s Sky</a>, <a href="http://pulsarthegame.com/">Pulsar: Lost Colony</a>, <a href="http://elliptic-games.com/">Rodina</a>, <a href="http://www.spaceengineersgame.com/">Space Engineers</a>, <a href="http://star-made.org/">Star Made</a>, <a href="http://playstarbound.com/">Starbound</a>, <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/about-the-game">Star Citizen</a>, and <a href="http://www.starpointgemini.com/">Starpoint Gemini 2</a>. </p>
<p>Did I miss any?</p>
<p><strong>34:00 Chris is playing Call of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Juarez:_Gunslinger">Juarez: Gunslinger</a>.</strong></p>
<p>We only cover this briefly. Not because there’s nothing to talk about, but Rutskarn already went over this a couple of months ago.</p>
<p><strong>38:30 Chris is also playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bureau:_XCOM_Declassified">The Bureau: XCOM Declassified</a></strong></p>

      <itunes:summary>This episode was recorded AFTER our Spoiler Warning session this week, but it’s being released first. We were a little tired and a couple of hosts short by the time we got to this point. 


Hosts: Josh, Chris, and Shamus.

Show notes:

1:00 Shamus is playing Elder Scrolls Online and EVE Online.

We can’t talk about ESO yet. (Embargoed until Feburay 7th.) But we can talk about the battle of B-R5RB. Note that we had this conversation before I did the homework for my recent EVE post.

28:00 We move on from EVE and talk about space games more broadly.

Like I said in the show, there are a lot of space games on the way. Check it out: Blockade Runner, Elite: Dangerous, Felix Vast, Kerbal Space Program, Kinetic Void, Limit Theory, The Mandate, No Man’s Sky, Pulsar: Lost Colony, Rodina, Space Engineers, Star Made, Starbound, Star Citizen, and Starpoint Gemini 2. 

Did I miss any?

34:00 Chris is playing Call of Juarez: Gunslinger.

We only cover this briefly. Not because there’s nothing to talk about, but Rutskarn already went over this a couple of months ago.

38:30 Chris is also playing The Bureau: XCOM Declassified

Here’s the rant (and comic) that I wrote about this game way back in 2010, when it was still in development. Here’s the Polygon Article Chris mentioned: The many faces of the bureau: xcom declassified: from 2006 to 2013

This conversation got sidetracked into…

43:00 Another Mass Effect rant? Really? REALLY?

I blame Chris. 

53:00 Mailbag!

We talk about Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition and about Steam Early Access program and the difficulties of defining when a game is “done”.

Request: When you send us a question (the address is in the splash image at the top of the post) please put “Diecast” in the title so Josh can find them when we finally get around to reading them.

<p>Show notes: </p>
<p><span id="more-21987"></span><strong>01:00 Shamus got over his Skyrim problem and made screensaver.</strong></p>
<p>For the record, the mods I was using are <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26228/?">Realistic Needs &amp; Diseases</a>, <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11163/?">Frostfall</a>, and <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25404/?">Random Alternate Start</a>, along with about 40 others.</p>
<p>I already talked about the screensaver <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=21977" title="Passage Screensaver">earlier this week</a>.</p>
<p><strong>13:00 The Elder Scrolls Online</strong></p>
<p>Here is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZUynhkal1I" title="TUN: The Elder Scrolls VI - Youtubia">Nerdrage video on Elder Scrolls</a>. </p>
<p><strong>51:30 Chris is writing things and talking about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbv9rs9bVOE">Alien Isolation</a>.</strong></p>
<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien:_Isolation">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Alien Isolation] is set in 2137, 15 years after the events of Alien and 42 years before the events of Aliens. It focuses on Ellen Ripley’s daughter Amanda who, while in search for her mother, goes to a space station: Sevastopol, unaware that the Xenomorphs have already infested the place.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whaaat?</p>
<p>So you’re playing as Ripley’s daughter. Who is an adult. Not only does this muck with establish canon, but it drags in a character that was better left where she was: Having lived a perfectly mundane and unremarkable life on Earth. </p>
<p>A much better idea? Let us play as Newt. You wouldn’t have to screw with any existing lore, and the mechanics are all right there in the movie: Newt survives by hiding in tight spots and using her wits. She can crawl through the duct work and watch the Aliens tear through the colonists. We’ve got a huge installation to work with and lots of blank space on the timeline. It would be a very cat-and-mouse type stealth, where the tension comes from the times when you’re obliged to leave the safety of the vents and venture into the open to accomplish something. </p>
<p>I’m not saying it can’t be a great game, but the whole “Ripley’s daughter” thing smacks of ham-handed fanfiction. </p>
<p>Having said that: This is the first Alien game in ages that sounds promising. Survival stealth? Oh yeah. I’m on board with that.</p>

13:00 The Elder Scrolls Online

Here is the Nerdrage video on Elder Scrolls. 

51:30 Chris is writing things and talking about Alien Isolation.

From Wikipedia:

[Alien Isolation] is set in 2137, 15 years after the events of Alien and 42 years before the events of Aliens. It focuses on Ellen Ripley’s daughter Amanda who, while in search for her mother, goes to a space station: Sevastopol, unaware that the Xenomorphs have already infested the place.
Whaaat?

So you’re playing as Ripley’s daughter. Who is an adult. Not only does this muck with establish canon, but it drags in a character that was better left where she was: Having lived a perfectly mundane and unremarkable life on Earth. 

A much better idea? Let us play as Newt. You wouldn’t have to screw with any existing lore, and the mechanics are all right there in the movie: Newt survives by hiding in tight spots and using her wits. She can crawl through the duct work and watch the Aliens tear through the colonists. We’ve got a huge installation to work with and lots of blank space on the timeline. It would be a very cat-and-mouse type stealth, where the tension comes from the times when you’re obliged to leave the safety of the vents and venture into the open to accomplish something. 

I’m not saying it can’t be a great game, but the whole “Ripley’s daughter” thing smacks of ham-handed fanfiction.

<p>I find this <em>incredibly encouraging</em>. I might give this topic a post of its own, but the short version is that by sponsoring a show directly, the money ends up in the hands of the people who make the content we love. Compare this to the old model where:</p>
<ol>
<li>Acme buys advertising space on YouTube.
</li><li>The ad runs on a video made by Bob.
</li><li>Carla clicks on the ad. (Probably by accident, if my own surfing habits are any indication.)
</li><li>YouTube gives a tiny little bit of the advertising money to Bob.
</li></ol>
<p>And all too often:</p>
<ol>
<li value="5">Actually, some jackass copyright troll flags Bob as producing infringing content and siphons off some of his revenue while Bob spends time disputing the claim instead of making more content.
</li></ol>
<p>Acme can’t tell where their ad shows up or who will see it in this madcap YouTube world.  YouTube doesn’t care about the quality of Bob’s show as long as people watch it. Bob doesn’t care about Acme as long as he gets his money. When Carla clicks, it’s not because she likes Bob’s show, but because she’s ostensibly interested in Acme. The parties all have goals that are either completely unrelated or even in conflict. </p>
<p>It’s an awful system, and the only reason we’re using it is because we don’t have anything better. Services like Subbable and Patreon might be a way to route around this madness. </p>
<p>Like Errant Signal? Want to encourage it? <a href="http://www.patreon.com/errantsignal">You can support it here</a>. And as Chris is quick to say: <em>The show will continue whether you give or not.</em> Giving is your way of saying, “Dear internet. Make more stuff like this.”</p>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Happy new year! Rather than doing a big year-end retrospective, we talked about the here &amp; now like we usually do. </p>

<p>Note that I produced this episode. Josh usually does it, but he’s visiting his parents and doesn’t have access to his normal equipment. So any complaints about the audio quality should be directed at me. Note also that I make about two episodes a year, so your complaints won’t do any good because I end up re-learning the whole process from scratch every time. </p>
<p>Hosts: <a href="http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/">Chris</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus">Josh</a>, <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale">Shamus</a>.</p>
<p>Show notes:<span id="more-21904"></span><br>
<strong>3:00 Josh is sick, and so he’s taking <a href="http://www.fireballwhisky.com/index.cfm">Fireball Whiskey</a> in search of the cure.</strong></p>
<p>To be clear, I don’t know if gargling with alcohol is medically useful for killing throat-based infections, but it FEELS like it helps. The only reason I doubt it is: If all you needed to do to kill throat cultures was gargle alcohol, wouldn’t they have figured it out ages ago? Wouldn’t this just be standard procedure for sore throats? </p>
<p>As an aside: How could you do a proper <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment">double-blind</a> study on this? With most tests, you can easily administer a placebo without detection. But the test subject is going to feel that alcohol in their throat and the control subject won’t, and that sensation is going to skew the results. I don’t know.

      <itunes:summary>Happy new year! Rather than doing a big year-end retrospective, we talked about the here &amp; now like we usually do. 


Note that I produced this episode. Josh usually does it, but he’s visiting his parents and doesn’t have access to his normal equipment. So any complaints about the audio quality should be directed at me. Note also that I make about two episodes a year, so your complaints won’t do any good because I end up re-learning the whole process from scratch every time. 

Hosts: Chris, Josh, Shamus.

Show notes:
3:00 Josh is sick, and so he’s taking Fireball Whiskey in search of the cure.

To be clear, I don’t know if gargling with alcohol is medically useful for killing throat-based infections, but it FEELS like it helps. The only reason I doubt it is: If all you needed to do to kill throat cultures was gargle alcohol, wouldn’t they have figured it out ages ago? Wouldn’t this just be standard procedure for sore throats? 

As an aside: How could you do a proper double-blind study on this? With most tests, you can easily administer a placebo without detection. But the test subject is going to feel that alcohol in their throat and the control subject won’t, and that sensation is going to skew the results. I don’t know. I  think the best solution is for us to make a field trip to the liquor store and begin what I’m calling a “blind drunk trial”.

Given how good it feels, I can’t believe this treatment doesn’t go all the way back to the middle ages.

8:30 Josh got Tie Fighter working on his tablet, using a 360 controller with Dos Box.

This is madness. Awesome madness.

9:00 Josh is playing Project Zomboid

We throw out the term “offsite SVN” without explaining it.  For the record, SVN is a system for keeping track of source code. An offsite one is a place where you can upload your code so that even if your computer gets hit by an asteroid, you still have a complete record of your code, your documentation, and the history of the project. VERY useful. I use BitBucket.

Also, I claimed I was a “one man operation”, which is completely untrue. I have Peter Olson going over my revisions and making sure it all works on Linux.

19:00 Chris is playing The Pinball Arcade and Simpsons: Tapped Out.

27:00 We talk about the new Rise of the Triad. Here is footage of the original.

35:00 Shamus is playing Skyrim. 

We talk about the oddball leveling, the screwy balance, the broken economy, and the way the modding scene is becoming more visible and useful to the community.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>You know what we need more of around here? Controversy. Nothing livens things up more than gnawing on the old bones of a horse that was flogged to death in the flamewars of yesteryear. If we’re lucky, we might get through this without having some kind of rage-driven meltdown. </p>

<p>Show notes:</p>
<p><span id="more-21557"></span><strong>00:30 We talk about Battlefield 4 and how the matchmaking / server browser is cutting-edge 1996 technology. </strong></p>
<p><strong>18:00 Chris talks about the single-player aspects of Battlefield 4. </strong></p>
<p><strong>24:00 The Telltale segment: <a href="https://www.telltalegames.com/thewolfamongus/">Wolf Among Us</a> and <a href="http://www.telltalegames.com/walkingdead/">The Walking Dead</a>.</strong></p>
<p>This is a non-spoiler discussion, mostly talking about how Telltale is moving TWD forward and discussing what we hope / expect / guess will be in Season 2. </p>
<p><strong>35:00 Mumbles talks about <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/marvels-agents-of-shield">Agents of SHIELD</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Related: <a href="http://penny-arcade.com/comic/2013/11/11">This Penny Arcade strip</a>.</p>
<p>Chris references this gem: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFHlJ2voJHY">MST3K – Space Mutiny – The many names of David Ryder</a></p>
<p><strong>48:30 Shamus is playing vanilla Minecraft 1.7.2. </strong></p>
<p>If you’re curious, the map project I mentioned is this:</p>
<p></p><table class="" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" align="center"><tbody><tr><td><img src="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/images/minecraft_atlas.jpg?189db0&amp;189db0" class="insetimage" alt="minecraft_atlas.jpg" title="minecraft_atlas.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
<p><strong>49:00 Mailbag:</strong></p>
<p>Neil (or Neal? Or perhaps Kneel? I don’t have the email handy) asks:</p>
<p><em>“How much do you think the bad behavior of and reputation of so-called “gaming culture” has to do with it coinciding with the transparency and anonymity of the internet?”</em></p>
<p>This might be our favorite question so far. It certainly launched the most discussion, and I’ll bet we could have filled an entire episode on the topic if we wanted.</p>
<p>During this discussion I mention <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/jimquisition/8371-Cloak-and-Dagger">this episode of Jimquisition</a>, talking about how most game journalism is simply relaying information provided by marketing. We also discuss <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>‘s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_(comics)">Angela</a> character. <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/the-big-picture/7075-Marvel-Mess">The business side of her character</a> is a lot more interesting than the narrative side.</p>
<p><strong>1:04:30 Why gender-based discussions suck so bad.</strong></p>
<p>Hoping we can get through this topic with minimal loss of life.</p>

      <itunes:summary>You know what we need more of around here? Controversy. Nothing livens things up more than gnawing on the old bones of a horse that was flogged to death in the flamewars of yesteryear. If we’re lucky, we might get through this without having some kind of rage-driven meltdown. 


Show notes:

00:30 We talk about Battlefield 4 and how the matchmaking / server browser is cutting-edge 1996 technology. 

18:00 Chris talks about the single-player aspects of Battlefield 4. 

24:00 The Telltale segment: Wolf Among Us and The Walking Dead.

This is a non-spoiler discussion, mostly talking about how Telltale is moving TWD forward and discussing what we hope / expect / guess will be in Season 2. 

35:00 Mumbles talks about Agents of SHIELD.

Related: This Penny Arcade strip.

Chris references this gem: MST3K – Space Mutiny – The many names of David Ryder

48:30 Shamus is playing vanilla Minecraft 1.7.2. 

If you’re curious, the map project I mentioned is this:




49:00 Mailbag:

Neil (or Neal? Or perhaps Kneel? I don’t have the email handy) asks:

“How much do you think the bad behavior of and reputation of so-called “gaming culture” has to do with it coinciding with the transparency and anonymity of the internet?”

This might be our favorite question so far. It certainly launched the most discussion, and I’ll bet we could have filled an entire episode on the topic if we wanted.

During this discussion I mention this episode of Jimquisition, talking about how most game journalism is simply relaying information provided by marketing. We also discuss Neil Gaiman‘s Angela character. The business side of her character is a lot more interesting than the narrative side.

1:04:30 Why gender-based discussions suck so bad.

Hoping we can get through this topic with minimal loss of life.

We also spend some time talking about good ol’ Team Fortress 2 and how the game has changed.

<p>While the stuff we discuss are spoilers in the technical sense, I don’t know if we’re actually likely to ruin any surprises. I’m not even sure the conversation will make sense.

<p>Correct on all counts. I’m 42, my daughter is about to turn 16, and I barely remember the game aside from being angry at the end. Also relevant is <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=1006">this ancient post on why I dislike episodic games</a>. </p>

      <itunes:summary>Feel sorry for Chris.  We got to do the podcast this week, while he was forced away from his job and dragged to Disney World. He’s probably miserable right now, sitting in the gorgeous weather and scenery, drinking a beer, and wishing he was with his internet-friends. He can’t even produce an Errant Signal from there. Poor guy.


Hosts: Rutskarn, Josh, Mumbles, and Shamus.

Show notes: 

1:00 Shamus is annoyed with how the game Brothers ended.

SPOILERS! We go on to compare other well-known downer endings and talk about what makes an ending work and what doesn’t. We talk about The Walking Dead, Mass Effect 3, and Brothers. It was impossible to have this conversation without a few spoilers. 

I still recommend Brothers, and I recommend spoiling the ending first. 

7:45 Mumbles is Birthday-ing this week. She’s also playing GTA V. 

22:00 Here we ramble our way into talking Borderlands 2. 

26:30 Josh talks a little bit about his experience playing Good Robot.

31:30 Talking about Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs.

34:00 Rutskarn is playing FTL and Gunpoint.

53:00 Mailbag!

In talking about Dreamfall, I referenced my old rant on the end of the game. Check it out:

      <itunes:summary>As all of you demanded, here’s a rambly show that’s mostly about what we’re doing. Well, some of you wanted this. I distinctly remember one or two of you saying you wouldn’t mind a directionless show. Occasionally. So here it is!

I hope you like it because these are way easier to produce we’re eager to please!


Hosts: Rutskarn, Josh, Chris, and Shamus.

Show notes:


1:00 What’s everyone doing this week?

Shamus is writing code, writing about writing code, and in this show he’s talking about writing about writing code.

Rutskarn is playing AD&amp;D. Here is Fate Core, which we discussed.

17:30 Josh is playing… Fireball Whiskey? Somehow? It’s the incinerator of whiskies! 

He’s also playing Hate Plus, sequel to Analogue: A Hate Story. I’m giving this bit its own segment here in the notes because it runs long and it has spoilers for the first game. 

27:30 Chris is playing a lot of stuff. To wit:

Disney Infinity, Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell: Blacklist and Saints Row IV.

50:00 Elder Scrolls Online will have subscription fees. 

Story here. We also discuss Wildstar.

Shamus Young is a programmer, an author, and nearly a composer. He works on this site full time. If you’d like to support him, you can do so via Patreon or PayPal.

        <![CDATA[<p>We don’t talk about Gone Home in this episode, but we wanted to. We do spend the first segment of the show talking about how we reacted to the game. I don’t know if it’ll get its own one-off special, or if we’ll just give it a couple of weeks so people can play through it. But I will say the response from the cast is universally positive. </p>

<p><strong>01:00 What is all the peoples doing this week?</strong></p>
<p>Josh is playing Gone Home. He’s also playing Warthunder and suggests that you <a href="http://warthunder.com/en/registration?r=userinvite_1186666">sign up using this link</a> in order to most optimally benefit him.</p>
<p>Chris is playing Gone Home and Spelunky. He also made <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNDk7D0yG0">this video about Gone Home</a>.</p>
<p>Mumbles is playing Gone Home and Guild Wars 2.</p>
<p>Shamus is playing Gone Home, <a href="http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/games/avww-features">Valley Without Wind</a>, and <a href="http://kairo.lockeddoorpuzzle.com/">Kairo</a>. (I called it “Kairos” throughout this segment. In my defense, a friend of mine owned a coffee shop called Kairos and saying “Kairo” is like trying to say “Borderland”. It’s hard to make my mouth stop before the s!) But mostly coding.</p>
<p>Rutskarn is playing the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble Origin Bundle</a>. </p>
<p><strong>27:00 (ish) The Sims, in general. </strong></p>
<p>Not a planned topic, but we spent some time talking about it.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>We spend a lot of time talking about what we’re playing. Conceptually the Diecast has three segments: The personal warm-up talk about what we’re playing, the supposedly informed discussion of current gaming news, and the mailbag. Often a third of the show is spent on the warmup, and the mailbag often gets pushed out. How do you guys feel about that? Would you rather more news discussion? Or more mailbag?</p>
<p>Not that we’re promising to change anything. I’m just askin’. </p>

<p>In other news: Someone suggested that putting the fully qualified URL to the audio in the RSS feed would help the Diecast show up for podcasting software.  I have done this. I’m sure you’ll let me know if it helped. </p>

      <itunes:summary>I’m pretty proud of the conversation we had about game journalism.  We had a lot of different views, we looked at it from a lot of different angles, and I think some smart things were said. 

In other news: Someone suggested that putting the fully qualified URL to the audio in the RSS feed would help the Diecast show up for podcasting software.  I have done this. I’m sure you’ll let me know if it helped. 


Hosts: Shamus, Josh, and Mumbles, Chris but not Rutskarn.

Show notes:

02:30  What’s everyone doing?


20:00 Warren Spector: Where’s Gaming’s Roger Ebert?


45:30 Pacific Rim. (And then Rutskarn shows up and we talk about random things for 15 minutes.

58:30 Mumbles talks comics!

1:17:30 Mailbag.

        <![CDATA[<p>Some behind-the-scenes info: We generally forward news stories to each other all week. When Sunday rolls around, we take the headlines for the week, sort them out, and figure out which ones we want to talk about and which ones we don’t. Then we record the show.</p>
<p>This week we had nothing. Not one news story. I don’t know if we weren’t following the news or we didn’t care, but we had no stories and nothing to say. We just got together for our once-a-week blather session and Josh began recording halfway through. That means this podcast is even less structured than last week. Just so you know what you’re getting into. In any case, the choice was between this and nothing.</p>
<p>We’ve got a good slate of stories now, so the Diecast should return to normal next week. In the meantime, you’ve been warned:</p>

<p>Show notes:</p>
<p><span id="more-20279"></span><strong>00:00</strong> No introductions. No host. No news items. NO HOPE.</p>
<p><strong>00:30</strong> We join the podcast in mid-conversation, talking about <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1022603/">500 Days of Summer</a> and Scott Pilgrim. For reference, <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=8999" title="Scott Pilgrim vs. MY FACE">here is what I had to say about Scott Pilgrim when it came out</a>. The <a href="http://moviebob.blogspot.com/">MovieBob</a> video <a href="http://www.chocolatehammer.org/" title="Chocolate Hammer">Rutskarn</a> mentioned is here: <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/the-big-picture/7373-Dumping-Irony" title="The Big Picture: Dumping Irony">The Big Picture: Dumping Irony</a>. </p>
<p><strong>09:30</strong> We troll <a href="http://digitalmumbles.com/">Mumbles</a> by not talking about Batman. Instead we talk about Green Lantern, The Aristocrats, and Tacos. </p>
<p><strong>15:00</strong> <a href="http://www.scribblenauts.com/scribblenauts/unmasked">Scribblenauts</a></p>
<p><strong>24:00</strong> Josh is playing Skyrim. Mumbles video on Skyrim is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84WvpwyEJw8" title="The Mumbles Problem: Skyrim">here</a>. Then we segue into talking about Fallout: New Vegas</p>
<p><strong>52:30</strong> MAILBAG! We discuss sharing the hobby, the Kinect, and visual fidelity and game budgets.</p>
<p>Also, I want to apologize to Neil (or Neal) who sent in the long question. While short questions are always better than long in this format, that’s no reason for me to be a jerk about it. Bad form. In my defense, we’d been at this for a couple of hours by this point and I was getting a bit frazzled. </p>
<p>If you’ve got a question for the cast, send it to <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" >[email&nbsp;protected]</a> Also: Short questions make for better launching points for conversation. Long questions are better left in the comments. (I used to have a special page where people could leave long questions for me to answer. Looks like it got culled last time I tinkered with the site. I’ll look into bringing that back.)</p>

Shamus is playing Thief 2 and Thief 3.

Rutskarn is playing BioShock Infinite.  

Jarenth is playing BioShock Infinite and Anodyne.

Chris is playing BioShock Infinite.

Josh is recovering from surgery where nope it’s too gross for me to type you’ll have to listen and hear for yourself. The “shattering ribcage” joke was a reference to Surgery Simulator 2013, which is probably the greatest misappropriation of the word “simulator” in the history of games. 

Shamus was playing BioShock Infinite and BioShock Infinite.

12:00 Horrible SimCity news this week: Here is the max happiness, max density city with no public services, no jobs, no goods, no resources, no government, no electricity, no hospitals, no crime, no homelessness, and no police. Here is the Something is Wrong With The Offices post that Josh referenced. Here is the video of the broken roads in SimCity. But don’t get worked up, because American McGee thinks everyone needs to calm down.

<p>We should probably title these things or something. I mean, if we’re going to keep making episodes then at some point we’ll be like, “Wait. Which one did we discuss playing through Half-Life 2: Episode 3? Was that Diecast #230? No, 230 was when we discussed Sony’s inexplicable decision to design the Playstation 5 with a cotton-candy pink case.” </p>
<p>Then again, I have no idea how to title long multi-topic discussions in a memorable way. Screw it. We’ll just kick this problem on down the road and let future-us deal with it.</p>

<p>Show notes:</p>
<p><strong>00:15</strong> Intro. What’s everyone doing?  Shamus is playing Max Payne 3. (I suppose I might as well link to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU0dgjon10U" title="A Day in the Life of Max Payne">that one Max Payne video</a> before someone beats me to it.) Rutskarn is playing KOTOR2. Chris is playing <a href="https://www.digipen.edu/?id=1170&amp;proj=25930">Perspective</a>. Josh is playing…</p>
<p><strong>17:00</strong> Tomb Raider. The new one. Like, the reboot. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCKHlO9C7Lc">This one</a>.</p>
<p><strong>40:00</strong> SimCity. Man, does this story have legs or what? We recorded this on Sunday night, and here on Thursday the follies continue. Sadly, this means a lot of the stuff we discussed or speculated about has now been resolved or rendered moot, only to be replaced by new failures. The latest? <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/03/12/simcity-server-not-necessary/" title="Maxis Insider Tells RPS: SimCity Servers Not Necessary">Maxis Insider Tells RPS: SimCity Servers Not Necessary</a>.  </p>
<p>This reminds me so much of the ages-old <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=1290" title="Bioshock: Miss Misinformation">BioShock controversy</a>: A polite spokeswoman is way out of her technical depth and saying things that the tech-savvy users prove to be untrue, thus making inflaming the people they were trying to pacify. Those who do not learn from history, etc. (They are also repeating the mistakes of the Diablo III launch and the Assassin’s Creed 2 launch. So, nice going EA. You are the very last idiot to make this particular blunder.)</p>
<p><strong>1:03:30</strong> The Blip.tv story. <a href="http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/?p=467" title="Errant Signal">Here is what Chris posted about it</a>. And here is the original post where I hurled bricks at the company after too many trips through the same advertisement: <a href="http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=12158" title="Blip.TV Sucks">Blip.tv Sucks</a>. Stay classy, Shamus. </p>

      <itunes:summary>We should probably title these things or something. I mean, if we’re going to keep making episodes then at some point we’ll be like, “Wait. Which one did we discuss playing through Half-Life 2: Episode 3? Was that Diecast #230? No, 230 was when we discussed Sony’s inexplicable decision to design the Playstation 5 with a cotton-candy pink case.” 

Then again, I have no idea how to title long multi-topic discussions in a memorable way. Screw it. We’ll just kick this problem on down the road and let future-us deal with it.


Show notes:

00:15 Intro. What’s everyone doing?  Shamus is playing Max Payne 3. (I suppose I might as well link to that one Max Payne video before someone beats me to it.) Rutskarn is playing KOTOR2. Chris is playing Perspective. Josh is playing…

17:00 Tomb Raider. The new one. Like, the reboot. This one.

40:00 SimCity. Man, does this story have legs or what? We recorded this on Sunday night, and here on Thursday the follies continue. Sadly, this means a lot of the stuff we discussed or speculated about has now been resolved or rendered moot, only to be replaced by new failures. The latest? Maxis Insider Tells RPS: SimCity Servers Not Necessary.  

This reminds me so much of the ages-old BioShock controversy: A polite spokeswoman is way out of her technical depth and saying things that the tech-savvy users prove to be untrue, thus making inflaming the people they were trying to pacify. Those who do not learn from history, etc. (They are also repeating the mistakes of the Diablo III launch and the Assassin’s Creed 2 launch. So, nice going EA. You are the very last idiot to make this particular blunder.)

1:03:30 The Blip.tv story. Here is what Chris posted about it. And here is the original post where I hurled bricks at the company after too many trips through the same advertisement: Blip.tv Sucks. Stay classy, Shamus.

<p>With Shamus out for the week, I host and Jarenth guest stars on this exciting installment of the Diecast!</p>

<p>And now for the show notes, complete with the oft-requested timestamps!</p>
<p>00:15 – We talk about what we’ve been doing for the past week. Shamus is a zombie, Chris is a Tomb Raider, Rutskarn is Homestuck, Jarenth’s lost in Echo Bazaar, and I’ve been set on the Path of Exile.</p>
<p>15:55 – Everything and more about the Playstation 4 announcement, and in particular, the implication that “more polygons = stronger emotional connection.” And if you don’t want to watch the whole thing, VideoGamerTV made a helpful <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJDn0jRnUQ">abridged version of the conference</a> that has basically everything that’s important in it.</p>
<p>33:00 – We discuss the closure of Civilization World and what it can tell us about the state of Social Games, and how it compares to a similar collapse of the MMO space.</p>
<p>48:00 – Crytek jumps on the free-to-play bandwagon and is also very bad at naming things. We also talk about Cevat Yerli’s <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/28/crytek-reveals-the-many-faces-of-free-to-play?">statement</a> that “…the notion of a single-player experience has to go away.”</p>
<p>1:02:15 – Round Table Discussion: Are the Elder Scrolls games getting better or worse?</p>
<p>1:18:00 – We round out the podcast with the Assassin’s Creed 4 announcement. I hope you like pirates, because… uh… well I’m not really sure where the hell they’re going with this. Assassins and pirates? Are we going to finally see a video game about pirates versus ninjas? I don’t know, but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3jKH5peHt8">here’s the announcement trailer.</a></p>

<li>Whatcha doooin’? Josh is dealing with life stuff. Chris is playing <a href="http://www.gog.com/gamecard/system_shock_2">System Shock 2 from Good Old Games OH MY GOSH SO HAPPY</a>. And also <a href="http://www.gog.com/gamecard/daikatana">Daikatana</a>. Rutskarn is still playing <em>Far Cry 3: Cry Some More</em> and <a href="http://www.antichamber-game.com/">Antichamber</a>. And I’m still playing Minecraft using the <a href="http://www.technicpack.net/tekkit/">Tekkit Launcher</a>.
</li><li>Here is the trailer for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=WGLHLylUZFw">Star Trek: Flying A Space-Gun Through SPAAAACE Edition</a>.
</li><li>Note that this story about how <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/article/68576/electronic-arts-focusing-on-hits">EA is Focusing on “fewer titles” going into the next generation</a> is actually from 2011. But it talks about stuff that’s ongoing at EA. So the news is still relevant and worth discussing, just… old.
</li><li>Hey, did you know it’s <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/female-gears-of-war-protagonist-hard-to-justify-says-epic-6403996">unprofitable to have women as game protagonists</a>? As Rutskarn pointed out, this may be because they get <a href="http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/games-with-female-heroes-dont-sell-because-publishers-dont-support-them">half the marketing budget</a>.
</li><li>Here is a link to the <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/unskippable/656-X-Blades">Unskippable riff on the X-Blades intro</a>. My goodness was she nails-on-a-chalkboard awful. I mean, vapid, stupid humiliating pandering outfit, screechy voice, plastic face, completely uninteresting. Both of my daughters latched onto her. Not because she was a good character, but because it was the first time they’d been able to play as a female in an action game. The game lost some of its appeal when they realized she wasn’t wearing orange pants and they were staring at her bare ass.
</li><li>Here is <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/reviews/anime/6657-Anime-Review-Devil-May-Cry">Josh’s review of the Devil May Cry anime</a> on the Escapist.
</li><li><a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/colonial-marines-failure-why-it-may-be-impossible-to-recreate-james-cameron">Here’s the Ben Kuchera article</a> on making Aliens into a game. Which incidentally led to <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/experienced-points/10205-Aliens-Isnt-About-Shooting-Aliens?utm_source=features&amp;utm_medium=index_carousel&amp;utm_campaign=all">my Escapist column for this week</a>. I’ll give it a post of its own tomorrow, so if you want to respond to my article you might want to wait until then. Or not. Do what you like. I’m not your mum.
</li><li>Here is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0S7PLCqr8I">Two Best Friends Play System Shock 2</a>.
</li><li>We each pitch our own Aliens game. In the end, I think we conclude we’re awesome and someone should give us millions of dollars to make a game.
</li></ol>
<p>Housekeeping:</p>
<p><strong>Oh my gosh is the message-clipping pissing me off.</strong> To be clear, this is a bug that I’ve confirmed in Vent, which has existed for YEARS. If you record something long (like an hour and a half or more) then when you export the audio files it will randomly chop off the end of messages. That’s not us letting go of the push-to-talk button early. That’s vent being stupid. You can listen to the conversation in Vent and it sounds fine, but after export you get what you hear in the Diecast. So much rage.</p>
<p>You might suggest Mumble. Josh says Mumble sounds horrible. I wouldn’t know. I grew up in the 70’s and I thought 8-track players and cassette tapes sounded just dandy, and when compact disks came along I couldn’t even detect the increase in quality. </p>
<p>I’ve been a guest on a lot of different podcasts over the years, and they all use Skype. The thing is, <strong>I friggin hate Skype</strong>. It’s this obnoxious, clingy, self-important jackass of a program that’s constantly bouncing up and down in the system tray and begging for attention. You always need to go through multiple warning dialogs to get it to close, to the point where it’s actually more convenient to just kill it with task manager rather than listen to it go hysterical and warn me that I won’t be able to receive calls. Whenever I need Skype for doing a guest appearance I install it, do the spot, and then un-install it again. The thing reminds me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealPlayer#Controversies" title="Wikipedia">RealPlayer circa 1998</a>.  </p>
<p>Still, we’re working on making the show suck less.</p>
